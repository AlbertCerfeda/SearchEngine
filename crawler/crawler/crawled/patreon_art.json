But now instead of painting in a drafty garret under the eye of one wealthy benefactor, we get to paint in our own homes for a hundred benefactors who each exchange a few dollars to see our work in progress.  It is an exchange.  And I make art and/or content for you all the time.   Your support of my patreon is so needed- even one dollar a month adds up and makes a huge difference to me! We have a wonderful community for my patrons to share their art and angst both on discord and on facebook.  Also, patrons can get things like coloring pages, digital art, and little trinkets in the mail, as well as my whole heart and a lot of my angst. Here is an itemized list of the beings (spread across three households) the patreon dollars help keep alive: 10 people 5 chickens 7 cats  3 dogs 1 cockatiel 1 bearded dragon 1 boa  2 betta fish 3 cory cats 3 frogs 1 pleco assorted shrimp and snails assorted moss balls and house plants. If you got THIS far in reading this it was suggested I add our new baby, \"The House That Art & Angst Acquired\" to the list of beings supported and I agree. So add in the house and at least a ghost or two."},

A 77 acre beautiful farm located in the heart of the Catskill mountains. This is a dream come true. I have been a volunteer, then a full-time caregiver and volunteer coordinator at a farm sanctuary since 2014. In that time I learned what really matters: the animals, their care, and their happiness. I learned to be part of a real team of dedicated individuals working tirelessly for a shared cause. I learned how to work with staff, volunteers, the public, and other sanctuary organizations to do the very best for both the animals in my care and the others out there still in danger. And most importantly, I learned the joy and heartbreak of opening my heart to animals in need, and I found my true passion in life. There are so many animals out there in need, but I will focus on one section of that population: pigs. I feel this is where I can do the most good. My experience with pig rescue, care, and advocacy will give me the confidence to do the best for them. I want to offer rescue support, a forever home for as many pigs as is possible, hospice care, and the opportunity to ease the suffering of others thru advocacy and education.        When this dream began to take shape, I went to look at a property with a friend. The property had been a small scale ”farm to table” type facility. Pigs, goats and other smaller animals had been raised to go to slaughter at the frighteningly young age that most animals bred for food face. We saw some of the tools of the trade around the barn, and a chill went through me. The agent mentioned that there might be a pig still there; I insisted we find him immediately. That is when I meet Arthur, a beautiful 3 1/2 month old piglet. He came right to me, looking me in the face as if to ask my intentions. I knew it immediately.  “I am not leaving without this pig.\" The agent was confused, but after realizing I was completely serious, got the owner to agree to let me have him. I am very lucky to have friends who share my passion, so I had support and supplies on the way in minutes. When I called my friend Mike Stura from Skylands Rescue and Sanctuary to ask for a temporary home for Arthur he did not hesitate to say yes. So now Arthur, who was the last pig to be threatened with death at this place, will be the first pig to be offered sanctuary there. The place where Arthur was meant to die young and afraid will be the place where he learns to live, to love, and be loved in return. He will welcome new friends, he will be a teacher, he will get to be an old man, and finally, he will die in his own bed surrounded by people who love him.  This transformation will take a lot of work. I am up for the challenge, and I am lucky to have the support of experienced friends and connections in the sanctuary community to help me with this enormous task. But I need more. There is a huge amount of work to be done, and we cannot do it with passion alone. So can you help Arthur and me make our dream come true, for us and for all the others out there waiting for help?  Thank you, and welcome to Arthur’s Acres Instagram  Facebook"},

We also talk about all of the silly bollocks that goes on in this circus of a sport behind the scenes and between the fights.

It's a great piece of software !\n\t\tWe only quite recently started to play DnD again, remembering how good it was back in high school ! We're both DMing and playing in each other's campaigns, based on Exandria (Matthew Mercer's Critical Role Tal'Dorei and Wildemount settings !)\n\t \n\tA bit less time to play right now as we're still in the beginning of our Patreon campaign and we're still discovering and learning from our mistakes.\n\t\tI'm sure we'll find a good rhythm once settled in ! 🤞\n\t \n \n \n \n How does our Patreon work ? \n \n \n\tWe charge 'per release'. \n\t\tIt means that when we release a post containing assets for our patrons, you get charged the pledge amount in accordance to the tier you decided to pledge for.\n\t\tIf we release a second post within the same month, you only get charged if the maximum pledge you set is above your initial pledge.\n\t\tMoreover, \n\t if we don't release anything  for one month, for any reason at all,  you do not spend anything. \n\t \n\tTransparency is key for us to build a trust relationship with you.\n\t\tIt's only fair that we need to create stuff for you to support us !\n\t\tWe have to create and release posts to make some money and you spend however much you want or are comfortable with at any point in time.\n\t\tYou can change your tier, change your maximum pledge or even cancel your pledge and rejoin us \n\t at any moment .\n\t\tPatreon charges all members on the \n\t first of each month  (for the content released the month before)\n\t\tMore info can be found \n\t here \n\t We want to keep a high quality standard for our assets. Therefore, It is highly unlikely that we will ever release more than four paid posts per month.\n\t\tWe estimate our frequency of releases to stay between two and four per month depending on how inspired or otherwise busy we are !\n\t\tWe love making these assets and are overwhelmed with the support our patrons have shown us already !\n\t\tOur ultimate goal would be to pay our bills by continuing to create animations that you all enjoy !\n\t \n \n \n \n Do you need a Virtual Tabletop to make use of your assets ? \n \n\tNot necessarly I suppose ! \n\t\tThe animations we create are video files using the webm format.\n\t\tIt is a popular format designed for the web that is light in size and is now compatible with most internet browsers, even Edge !

Early Access! Watch almost every video at least 24 hours before it goes live for the world to see! Have I made a joke that will get me cancelled? Cancel me early! Get that hashtag going! Also, get ahead of the game with my upcoming projects. First dibs on any potential crowdfunding/merch releases/whatever that we end up doing! My first book was almost entirely funded by Patreons before the world knew about it! That was an accident, but now it’s a feature! Exclusive stuff! Sometimes we record things just for you fine folk at Patreon! It could be vegan chocolate tasting, watching an old Nintendo E3 conference, or the Minecraft series videos with my old, screaming PC case fan dubbed in over the top! This is apparently a thing people want!  YouTube and Twitch remain Ad and Sponsorship Free! I don’t like adverts. With Patreon they won’t be glued to the things I make.

Everyone’s a winner! But that’s not all! It used to be all, but we’ve changed it! On top of all of that we now have a few extra special tiers that will get you cool things for a few bob more.

Wow, look at all that goodness. If I was you I’d become a Patreon  immediately . It’s what all the cool kids are doing, and they’re  really  cool. Like, sunglasses cool. Sunglasses  cool . I’ll leave it with you - Daniel  xx"},

You take the role of a Guildmaster, a cunning or resolute leader of a rising Guild. As you build your Guildhall, you’ll recruit Infantry warriors, mounted cavalry units, and fearsome beasts. It’s up to you to lead your warband to face grueling battles against rival guilds, epic monstrosities and other sinister forces. Throughout a Campaign, you’ll embark on Quests to compete with other guilds for spoils and treasure. Each skirmish risks defeat and setback, but also the opportunity to seize unique relics and gain new powers. As your renown grows and the influence of your guild spreads, you’ll have the chance to attract Arcanists, Epic Heroes, and even Legendary Beasts to your cause Five powerful forces seek to conquer Mundus and bring the realm under their sway. Will your guild stand against the tide of Chaos and Corruption in the name of Order and Fortitude, or will the Wild grow resurgent? You and your guild may very well be the ones to tip the scales in the conflict for the fate of Mundus.GUILDS Rulebook0.802 is available to download in the Attachment!

A little over 11 years ago, I registered the web site  ForgottenWeapons.com  and created my first online repository of firearms information. It was a pretty small site at that time, with mostly archival photos from the Aberdeen Proving Grounds.  About 10 years ago, I took the next step and relaunched the site as a regularly-updated blog. This then became a more significant endeavor, posting new content 5 days/week. From the beginning, the focus has been on rare and unusual firearms, the more mechanically diverse the better. I have touched on common guns as well intermittently, as it is essential to have an understanding of the common guns in order to understand the development that went into them and their offshoots.  The content I maintain includes a wide spectrum of media:  Written articles Detailed photographs Original manuals Trials reports and other primary-source documents Video showing disassembly and function Video showing practical competition use My private goal from the very beginning of this project has been to create a comprehensive encyclopedia of firearms development. That is such a Quixotic goal that I don't generally mention it, but the project has grown so far beyond any of my expectations in the past years that my impossible goal looks a bit less impossible these days. It is still a lifetime's work at least, but I can't imagine anything I would rather be doing.  Dollars, Clams, Onions, Bucks, Dubloons, and Greenbacks Of course, it takes money to do. From basic things like paying for food and rent and insurance to supplying obscure ammunition for shooting to the much more significant costs of traveling to the museums and private collections where the rare and unique guns are housed. Thus far, I have funded my work with video advertisements on YouTube and Full30, and with the help of a couple sponsoring companies. However, my work is distinct from the vast majority of firearms media in that I rarely look at guns which are actually in production - and that really limits the possibility of finding corporate sponsors. On the other hand, that limitation is also a blessing in disguise as it prevents me from coming under the editorial control of any corporate overlord. On those occasions when I do discuss modern guns, I can say the truth as I see it without looking over my shoulder and worrying about the consequences of not properly buttering up any company. I cherish that independence, and I will not give it up. So what is the best way to fund an endeavor like Forgotten Weapons in today's world? Advertising has been the standard answer for a long time, largely because of simple carryover from places like television and print media. The Internet changes things, however. The Internet allows us to find any information we like without the overhead of printing presses or a finite number of cable channels. The potential audience for any information is unlimited, and that offers the prospect of sustainable micropayments. Having our daily lives flooded with advertisements is not a good thing, it's just the system we are most acclimated to. I think that a tiny amount of support from a huge number of people is a far better system, and Patreon looks like a way to achieve that model.  My Proposal From the very first HTML web site, I have had a policy that there will never be a paywall in front of Forgotten Weapons. First and foremost, my goal is to create a public archive of this information, and a paywall is anathema to that.  If you enjoy what I am creating and curating at Forgotten Weapons, this is a way you can contribute a buck a month to ensure that it keeps happening. If you want to contribute more that's wonderful - but a buck a month is all I am asking for. If there are enough people who find value in the work, that will be plenty sufficient to keep it alive and vibrant. Most Patreon creators offer a handful of different perks to entice people to donate more, and these usually entail special and exclusive content. I am not doing that, for two main reasons. First, I don't want to make special content accessible only to people who have paid - that goes against the \"free and public\" foundation of the endeavor. Second, I want to focus my time on the guns and history which are the whole point of Forgotten Weapons, rather than devote time to what are basically marketing gimmicks. You came here (presumably) because you like what I am doing already, so more (and better!) of that is what I am offering you. The perks that I have are about access to my time directly, while the entirety of the content I produce will remain freely and fully accessible to everyone."},

I'm a freelancer, writer, \"media artist,\" and video essayist. You might know me best from YouTube videos such as  This Is Phil Fish: A Case Study in Internet Fame ,  Things of Beauty: Super Smash Bros. as Spectator Sport , and  Why Are You So Angry? , a six part series about angry gamers and harassment. These were all posted on my channel,  Innuendo Studios . After wrapping a successful Kickstarter in 2014, I got to treat Innuendo Studios as a job, clearing some freelance work off my plate and releasing videos at a semi-regular clip. But Kickstarter money doesn't last forever, so Patreon is our shot at keeping the channel going indefinitely. If you're here, I'm assuming you know the basics of how Patreon works. (Just in case: think of Patreon as a subscription to my work. You pledge to throw a few dollars at me each time I release a video. If enough people make that pledge, I can afford to keep making them on the regular.) What I will tell you is that making these videos is the best job I've ever had. No matter what, I'm going to keep releasing videos as long as I feel I have things to say and there are people interested in hearing them. Just how often that is will be up to you! Let's talk goals: Right Now: Part-time Job At $800 per video, I can afford to keep the ads turned off on YouTube, no matter what. Between rent, bills, and student loans, I still can't promise any kind of regular schedule, but the videos will be making enough to justify making time for them whenever possible. This is the point where I can guarantee that Innuendo Studios isn't going anywhere. But it could be more if: At $1600 Per Month: Career This would cover rent, food, bills, basic cost of living, and maybe, now and again, a few hundred bucks in the savings account. I'd clear most freelance work from my schedule - just the stuff I can fit around Innuendo Studios. Bare minimum, 10-15 minutes of content would come out every month. This would also pay for additional things like written pieces ( did you know I do some writing? ). For the time being, this would be my job, and I'd get to keep working the best job in the universe! At $2400 Per Month: Media Empire This is shooting the moon and I'm not entire sure what happens here, but at this point Innuendo Studios could be a real... thing. Which means it could ramp up and branch out. We could boost the production values, start a podcast, give lectures at conferences, and who knows what else! I'd run some polls with the backers to see what things interest them, and we'd go from there. What You Get In Return $1 patrons will get the videos a day early. $5 patrons will get access to annotated versions of the videos (several of which already exist). And $10 patrons will get access to the Behind the Scenes blog where I talk shop about how the videos get made, what's in production, and as much data and observation about crowdfunding as I can manage - hopefully this will be useful to anyone thinking of running a crowdfunding campaign themselves. You would also get my deepest, sincerest thanks. Like, seriously, if you help keep this channel alive, you're on my list of rad people. Let's see if we can make the magic happen!"},

Every patron gets immediate access to a growing list of long form videos that document the subtle techniques of Thailand, and some of the greatest fighters who ever fought. In joining you not only can study these videos, but you are supporting the continuing process of finding, filming and detailing these masters of technique. The suggested pledge is $5. Below is a more general introduction to me, my Muay Thai fighting, blogging and videography, and why I ask for your support. 10% of all all pledges  is added to my Kru Fund, sent to the krus and ex-fighters who have made my Muay Thai Library possible.   Read about the Kru Fund here . I also add to the Kru Fund all net profits derived from the sale of my shorts and shirts:  www.8limbs.us/store for those who don't know me, this film short is a good introduction  The Things I Share and Think About After several years of writing out of pure passion I have transition to becoming a  professional  Muay Thai writer and to make my journalist efforts sustainable. Without this change my  8limbsus.com  writing would have likely come to an end. I've needed to start writing for my readers. The response has been pretty incredible, and sponsors have stepped up in support - and at this point 8limbsus.com, all of my writing, filming and fighting has become sustainable through my patron pledges. Most know me already because you've been following me for a while now. For those that don't my background: I began blogging about 10 years ago, around the same time I started putting up videos of my training  on YouTube . My hope has always been to just share with others what I'm experiencing, and to pass on the contact I was having with my teachers. But the YouTube channel grew, as did my blogging, and I eventually saved up enough money to move to Thailand to train and fight full time. And I started a small website as a home for my blogging and shares:  8limbsus.com .  I hit the ground running since I came to Thailand, and as you can see above I've pushed everything to the limit. I've fought 260+ times in that period (updated),  more in Thailand than any other westerner in history , man or woman. The entire time I've pushed myself to write and video share as much as I possibility could to help make things more clear, more imaginable for those back home. I know that before I came to Thailand there was very little I could find about what it is like to train and fight full time here, especially for women - I wanted to change that. And it may be fair to say that I've shared more in English on Muay Thai and Thai Muay Thai culture than anyone previously has, and hopefully I have inspired others to write and video share as well. The hope is that each fighter, each person, will put their story out there, create more ripples in the pond.  I've since expanded my Muay Thai writing to include a 2nd site devoted entirely to in-depth technique discussion and sharing:  sylviestudy.com . This was only accomplished through the support of my patrons, and it is a home for the concentrated study Thai legends and mental training observations. Adjunct to Sylvie Study is a new  Vimeo On Demand channel  that holds an Intensive Series, now 30 hours of training with single legends over multiple days. While the Muay Thai Library shows you a legendary kru or fighter in a single session, the Intensive series allows their style to unfold over many sessions, in some cases over 30. Historically there is no other documentation like this. Also, the On Demand set up allows me to raise money much more directly for the krus involved. They receive 55% of of the net profits of all On Demand sales, and get the chance to be supported by their knowledge directly. By tier, patrons can get promocodes for up to 15% discounts for these On Demand purchases.  Me as a Fighter - Making History Support me in Breaking the Unbreakable Record My incredible fight rate over these years has inspired me to take on the professional fighting record that has long thought to be untouchable: Boxer Len Wickwar's 470 documented fights, completed in 1947. This is going to take me the better part of 10 more years, but this is an enormous accomplishment to achieve, and I am asking everyone to cheer me on and life me up in it. You can read about that record and my attempt in my post:  Most Fights Ever: Chasing Len Wickar and the \"Untouchable\" Record.  This kind of record is so huge and would require so much support and endurance, it could only mean something on the larger scale of a community. I appreciate any support helping me get there, from cheering me on #ChasingLen to becoming a patron. Aside from the unbreakable Len Wickwar record, my other impossible goals include fighting for Olympic Gold, and eventually winning a Lumpinee belt (currently barred from women). You can  read about those goals here . What Do I Create? Aside from fighting and training like crazy on 8limbs.us I've liked to write about the  history of Muay Thai , and cover the female Muay Thai fighting scene in Thailand closely. I'm interested in contemporary Muay Thai gym culture, and  how western women fit in it . I share a lot of my training experiences, and  technical tips  that I have discovered from my various instructors, or that I have improvised. I vlog often. I also have been, in a larger sense  a reporter and advocate of female Thai fighters in Thailand . Those that have  subscribed to my blog  have receive a stream of varied information from Thailand over a 1,200 articles published since 2012. More than 50,000 follow my video content on  my YouTube channel  which has been documenting my training since the early days in Master K's basement (now more than 3,400 videos posted). It has been a full time job, but a labor of love. Some of  my best posts can be found here . If you haven't,  you can subscribe to my blog posts  here.  This isn't even to mention the exciting work I'm doing on  sylviestudy.com With patron help I've created the  Muay Thai Roundtable forum , the best deep discussion Muay Thai space on the Internet. For patrons in particular, beyond everything else, I've saved the best. I've created exclusive article and feature content. Here is a Table of Contents for the exclusive material patrons only can access:  Table of Contents - Exclusive material  - there are magazine level articles, diary entries, behind the scenes footage and interviews, burnout workouts, updates on my diet and nutrition, fight footage with my commentary, in-depth breakdown analysis of video with legends, and translated interviews with great fighters of Thailand's past. This is all in addition to the  Muay Thai Library itself , which is the foremost digital archive of Thai techniques available, anywhere, which patrons have access to. There is a huge amount of exclusive content for my patrons. Among all else I've also established a Muay Thai internet forum: The  Muay Thai Roundtable . This is a one of a kind internet space, designed for the sharing of knowledge, far from the argument-driven sites that are more common in the fighting arts. In fact, the forum also has a Women Only section where women can find fellow female athletes to turn to for support or as knowledge sources, as women often can find themselves isolated in gym spaces.  And Last But Not Least , aside from supporting me as a fighter and a writer, you are supporting the filming of my  Muay Thai Library documentary project . This is the most comprehensive long form documentation of Muay Thai technique effort in history. The aim is to film at least 250 hours with over 150 krus and ex-fighters, as they teach their Muay, each completed with audio commentary to make explicit many subtle things that might be hidden from viewers. Unlike many documentary projects this one allows you to see the Library in progress, as each session is published. Patron pledges make this project possible as I search out legends and lessor known krus across Thailand, hopefully preserving not only their techniques, many of them at the edge of being lost, but also the energies of these men who have given themselves to Muay Thai.  10% of all pledges go into my  Kru Fund . There are also several long term plans for books in the works, including a female fighter's guide for women in Thailand, and perhaps my personal story as well. Why Support My Content? This answer is simple. Support it because you value it. I have made it for the last several opening years free of charge, really just for the joy of it.  And I have benefited immensely from the connections to people I've made around the world through the sharing. I've come upon rough times, and the reality is that without support I very well may have to stop producing what I write and film. If it is meaningful to you to help give me a leg up to help make sure it continues and expands, I appreciate the aid to no end. staying touch as a patron: Subscribe to my Sylvie Study website:  www.bit.ly/sylvie-study Subscribe to my 8limbsus website:  www.bit.ly/sylvie-8limbsus Subscribe to my YouTube Channel:  www.bit.ly/sylvie-youtube Join the Muay Thai Roundtable Forum:  https://8limbsus.com/muay-thai-forum/ photo credit above:  Warriors of the Mongkon If you would prefer to donate and support directly with Bitcoin, you can do so with this address: 1BhaVE4A1uBTPnw5V6TWtGnHRT5E41cHSF"},

Unlike other fundraising services that raise for a single big event, Patreon supports ongoing creation and provides a means for new personal forms of interaction between artists and their supporters. This allows Cloud Cult to create a steady and long-term flow of music, conversation, and art for our Members (instead of relying on an album cycle every few years). Cloud Cult + Patreon = more Music, more Art, more Often! An overview of how Patreon works can be viewed in this great video primer  HERE . You simply sign up for a membership tier starting at as little as $3 per month. On the 1st of each month, that amount is automatically deducted from your card, and you are an ongoing member! As a  Cloud Cult Member/Patron , you then get access to a consistent flow of what we create, such as: New songs waaay before they are released to the general public Behind the scenes videos Early access to show tickets Live webcasts of concerts, rehearsals and studio-sessions Webchats with Cloud Cult band members Cloud Cult philosophical ponderings Drafts of songs in the making Personalized gifts from the band in the mail Free merchandise Free show tickets Your support means that we make more music. It means that we can explore, together, the questions that are central to our shared experience.   BECOME A MEMBER HERE The Evolution of Cloud Cult The music industry has gone through some drastic changes since Cloud Cult first began making albums. The traditional ways musicians used to make a living (selling CDs or digital downloads) are now virtually nonexistent as most music listeners subscribe to a music streaming service that allows them to listen to anything they want. This is fantastic for the listener, but the present compensation to independent artists from these services is virtually nothing. We're also one of the most eco-conscious bands out there (rated in the Top 10 by Rolling Stone Magazine), which means the profit on our merchandise is incredibly slim in comparison to selling conventionally manufactured merchandise (our products have always been 100% post-consumer recycled and/or organic). These principles also mean that when we receive generous offers to do things that would pay us well, like have our music in Coca Cola or Hummer commercials, we have said \"nope\". Or when we received a major label offer where the record company required that they make our merchandise with non-organic and non-recycled sources (because it's cheaper), we said no and stayed independent.  We are a band that is constantly reimagining what we can do together, and we believe platforms like Patreon are part of the next exciting evolution of the music industry. Cloud Cult Members are our core supporters and will receive exclusive access to a steady flow of new material. In addition, you are expanding our capacity for our ongoing charity work and community service through our own 501c3 nonprofit Earthology Institute, Park and Retreat Center and other charities that we have supported through donations and benefit concerts through the years! A Cloud Cult Member literally fuels the Cloud Cult ship, so we can keep making intentional art in an ethical and sustainable way.  We are fortunate to regularly hear the phrase \"Keep doing what you're doing\" from our supporters at shows. We, too, want the Cloud Cult ship to continue exploring big-picture questions with you through art, music, video (and who knows what else), and Patreon is how we are going to make that happen. But the only way for it to work is if enough of you become  Cloud Cult Members .  Thank you for joining us on this new journey! We wholeheartedly appreciate your support!"},

First of all thank you so much for checking out my Patreon page. I am a full time high school teacher doing my best to keep my art alive in whatever spare time I have. YouTube has been an amazing platform for me, where my viewers and subscribers have been so encouraging and have inspired me to share some of my creative explorations and lessons. It's been going better than I imagined, in such a relatively short time. Now I'm looking for help and support to take my art journey to the next level. Working as an art teacher, can be really rewarding, but also very time consuming and I'd love eventually to be able to produce my own art full time and spend all my day sharing my creative journey with my supporters. I've always been way more focused on developing my personal vision and achieving the best I can technically than I have making money from selling work. I have never liked the idea of my art being only for the rich and privileged few, so I will continue to create free content on YouTube and hope that access to my work continues to inspire those without the means to pay. I am looking forward to a time when I can really dig deeper into my own art practice and tutorials. Any help I receive from my supporters, will be massively encouraging for me to carry on building my vision and I hope by sharing my practice I will continue to help and inspire others along the way. I am happy to offer a variety of rewards, that will include full resolution images, sneak peeks at work in progress, exclusive videos for patrons etc. I would especially like to be able to offer a limited number of monthly one to one live Skype/Google hangout tutorials to people that really want to push forwards with their own practice or simply learn more about the way I work."},

Patreon is a website that allows me to offer one to two hour-long weekly painting and drawing tutorials and other artist rewards to a large number of people at a very low cost. It’s the perfect platform because we all benefit!  You get to save a lot of money on my weekly art lessons and in turn, you allow me to keep upgrading my equipment, pay rent, and make even more videos. It’s an endless cycle of awesome!! WHAT?! I like rewards!!! What do I get in addition to the tutorials?! You can choose to sign up for the $4/month or $9/month tier each with a different set of rewards! YAY STUFF!  For both $4 and $9/  month pledges - 1-2 Hour Long Painting & Drawing Tutorials  --  See my full patreon video library here! 4 new art lessons each month plus over 300 past lessons/demonstrations 5 monthly reference photos When you sign up at $4 or more a month, you get instant access to over 300 of my past 1-2 hour-long tutorials plus a new lesson every single week! These videos are slowed down to real-time for some sections and slightly sped up for others. I will explain what I’m doing and why I make certain decisions in the process while I work. With these videos being so much slower than my usual youtube videos you will have an easier time understanding my layering, blending and other techniques. These tutorials vary in medium each week. I rotate between Colored Pencil, Acrylic Painting, Oil Painting, Graphite and Inktense, watercolor pencil, watercolor, pan pastels and charcoal.  For both $4 and $9/  month pledges - 5 Royalty Free Reference Photos Each Month Each month I provide you with 5 reference photos I’ve taken myself! These photos are usually either wildlife or still life. You can use them in your own paintings or drawings! Make sure you download yours each month because I delete the previous month to make room for the next batch of new photos! When pledging $9/month, in addition to the 1-2 hour-long weekly tutorials (and don’t forget about over 300 past 1-2 hour long tutorials), you also get these extras!  For $9/month pledges you also get Postcards! 4 new art lessons each month plus over 300 past lessons/demonstrations 10 monthly reference photos total  group challenge Postcard with my artwork Each month you get a new postcard with one of my paintings or drawings printed on it! These postcards are sent the month following the month they are for (September cards go out in October etc), well they do when I’m on time. Even if I'm late on postcards (which is more often than not) and you cancel your membership, you will still get your postcards when I send the batch for the month you were a member!  $9/month pledges get 5 Additional Reference Photos That means you get a total of 10 new reference photos each month! Monthly Group Art Challenges Participate in a monthly art challenge designed to help you grow as an artist. Want extra advice on your art challenge painting or drawing? You will have access to a private facebook or MeWe group only open for those participating in the challenge where you can post photos of your work in progress and/or ask me questions on your art challenge painting/drawing.  For $14/month pledges, you also get coloring pages and a print discount! 4 new art lessons each month plus over 300 past lessons/demonstrations 10 monthly reference photos group challenge Postcard with my artwork 4 coloring pages each month My cost for all prints from  https://lachri.pixels.com Each month you get 4 new coloring pages based on my artwork! Sometimes this will be based on that week’s art lesson, but when the art lesson is from a reference photo you would need to pay for (like from wildlife reference photos) I will provide another fun coloring page off of past artwork. Can these coloring pages be used as line art for your actual paintings and drawings? Sure, but I don’t recommend it. Let me explain why.  I’ve been teaching painting and drawing lessons since 1999. In that time I’ve found that having students trace their references does help them to improve their drawing skills much faster than freehanding alone. However, I also found that you can hit a point where you’re doing too much for the student and you cross the line between helping someone to learn and just doing the work for them.  If I trace the work for you, you’re not learning to draw. You’re not learning how to take a reference photo of your own and have that tracing show you things in the reference you wouldn’t have otherwise noticed. I feel you’re skipping a very valuable step in helping you to improve your own work so that you can take any reference photo and make a beautiful painting from it.  If you want to use my coloring pages to create practice paintings you can, but you really will learn much more from tracing actual photos than my work. Besides that, the line drawing is not going to be as accurate as a photograph. I may include things that make for a better coloring page but may not be useful in your line art for your paintings. Discount on Prints I will have a new discount code each month that will give you my cost on any print from my print site  https://lachri.pixels.com/ Extra Photos from my social media I regularly post shots of my red eyed tree frogs, saltwater fish, greyhounds and more on my  MeWe  account. If you follow me there you are welcome at this tier to use any of those photos in your own artwork! I post more tree frog photos than anything else. For $19/month pledges, you also get greeting cards and a sticker! 4 new art lessons each month plus over 300 past lessons/demonstrations 10 monthly reference photos group challenge Postcard with my artwork 4 coloring pages each month My cost for all prints from  https://lachri.pixels.com 4.6\" x 7.2\" greeting card with my art Your postcards will now be included in the envelope with the greeting card Art sticker Greeting Card This card is 4.6x7.2\" printed on matte cardstock. The greeting card, sticker and your postcard will come in an envelope. The greeting card will always be a different painting than your postcard.  Sticker Each month you will get a new art related sticker! These will either be 2x3\" or 2x2\" Well wait a minute, What if I change my mind? That’s no problem at all! You’re free to cancel at any time. I promise this isn’t like a gym membership that won’t set you free! Patreon makes it very easy to cancel or change your pledge. Just go to your account settings and make any adjustments you like!"},

The sometimes unsolicited input I was giving others wasn't always being received well, despite the best of intentions. \"I'm concerned about the inflammatory cytokines your adipocytes may be secreting.\" Funny and awkward, I know. Granny just wasn't havin' it. The issue I was confronting in my social life was that I had come to realize that much of the human suffering on the planet might be avoided, or at least delayed – with the right information. The knowledge and experience I had begun accumulating in my diverse roles as a scientist – starting as early as my undergraduate days, when I was conducting lab experiments on worms to understand the aging process – had ignited a passion to share. I needed an outlet. Enter  FoundMyFitness. When you  read this website  or  watch our videos  or  listen to our podcasts , you are reaping the benefits of what has been the realization of a vision I had for empowering the people I care about to take action in their own lives to live better, happier, and even longer. Sometimes even modest, well-informed changes can drive larger results than might be expected by functioning as building blocks that create positive action in a feedforward pattern of behavioral change. But there is still a problem. Getting accurate information is difficult. Conflicting studies are published every day, raising difficult questions. Can I eat eggs? One day they're bad for us, the next month they're good for us, then a year later they're bad for us again. What about saturated fat? Some studies show it causes heart disease, and other studies say it may make you live longer. Sometimes perverse incentives fuel contradictions, and sometimes teasing out nuance from the scientific record just takes time. While I don't have all of the answers, one of the unique qualities of the FoundMyFitness approach to providing information — something I feel that we offer and very few platforms can even approach — is our special focus on taking some of the scientific topics subject to scrutiny from lay journalists and backtesting the narrative against what the scientific literature actually says across multiple types of evidence, from observational studies to controlled trials to mechanistic work. Each of these, in turn, contribute their own unique part of a better story that may weather the storm of publication bias and other challenges. If you value what the team and I are doing,  please consider becoming a Premium Member. When you become a FMF supporter, not only will you get member-exclusive content and access but you will also help us do more of the important work of FoundMyFitness: informing, sometimes even rebutting, but, more importantly, synthesizing cross-disciplinary science-focused content. With a bigger team, we can produce and deliver even more high-quality, well-researched information and the wider public and scientific community can continue to enjoy the (almost entirely free) beneficial impact of an utterly unique idea incubator serving the fields of aging, nutrition, wellness, mental health, well-being, and more. That means we need to grow. In order to make the economics work for the explicit purpose of creating more of the world's best content on healthspan, we've given special thought to how to do so in a way that, I hope, feels authentically additive and true to the founding ethos of FoundMyFitness of creating maximum value and impact – not just for members, but also the world. Moving forward,  we will offer a host of new benefits and an entire membership experience unique to what we are calling the \"premium membership\" tier.  My hope is that these newer, concrete benefits will be well worth the price of admission which is $15/month.

Thank you for stopping by and for your consideration in supporting me. My name is Karen Hallion and I am located on the Northshore of Massachusetts. I went to Ringling School of Art and Design and graduated with a BFA in Illustration, was an elementary school art teacher for many years and now I work full-time as an artist. I have done licensed work for some amazing companies such as LucasFilm, Cartoon Network, DreamWorks Studios, Her Universe, Disney, Patrick Rothfuss, Chronicle Books, as well as freelance work for Disney Imagineering.  In 2013, I won DreamWorks Studios’ “How to Train Your Dragon” t-shirt design contest. In 2015, I designed the art for the “Wizard School” card game created by DFTBA Games and Hank Green, which raised more than $450,000 via Kickstarter. I also raised more than $70,000 via Kickstarter in 2017 to fund the creation of my original character, Celara, via a 13 month calendar. In 2018, I was a contributing artist for the book Star Wars: Women of the Galaxy by Amy Ratcliffe and I illustrated the Doctor Who 13th #1 Newbury Comics Exclusive Variant Comic published by Titan Comics. And  I recently illustrated the exclusive covers for the 2019 Star Wars Celebration\nedition of Star Wars Insider Magazine. I created my Patreon page to build a place for myself and my fans to connect and interact in a more unique manner than on social media. Here you will fine exclusive content, videos, works in progress, sneak peaks, and more! You also have the opportunity to decide what I illustrate each month and make suggestions for future work. Your valued support of my Patreon page enables me to do what I love and for that, I am deeply grateful. Please read on for more details in the FAQs below and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any additional questions. I hope this platform serves as a place where you can not only support my business, but where you can be inspired and rewarded too! FAQ This FAQ is for my specific Patreon page and program. If you have questions about Patreon in general, questions about address changes for physical rewards, billing, payments, software, what patronage is, etc. please also visit the official  Patreon Help Center here: https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us Q: What is Patreon?  A: Patreon is a crowdfunding platform that enables artists to obtain funding from their fans or patrons. Patrons pledge to donate a fixed amount of money to an artist every month in exchange for rewards.  Q: How much does it cost? What do I get? A: Depending on what tier you subscribe to, anything from $1/month to $35 monthly. I have eight reward tiers; $1, $3, $5, $10, $15, $20, $25 and $35 and my rewards currently include downloadable coloring pages, tutorial videos, postcards and prints, depending on the level you choose. Each level builds upon the previous in terms of the rewards you receive. For example, if you choose the $10 reward, you'll have access to all the rewards below it at the $1, $3, $5 levels as well.  You can cancel your pledge or change your pledge amount at any point and will take effect the first of the following month. For detailed tier descriptions, look to the right of this text and read more about the rewards included in each level. Q: What does my money go for? A: Mainly, it goes towards supporting my career as an artist! It helps with the expenses of my day-to-day life, paying bills and maintaining my business, which includes buying merchandise, legal fees, and equipment costs such as my Cintiq, art supplies, website administration, and travel expenses so I can attend conventions to meet fans in person. Without the support from Patreon, I would have to find another full-time job, which would not allow me to create art or travel at my current capacity. To see my upcoming schedule of events, click here:  https://www.karenhallion.com/appearances Q: What do you use to draw/paint with? A: Most of my work is digital these days, I use Photoshop CC and a Wacom Cintiq 21UX. I also use brushes I purchased from Ray Frenden I love the organic inker one and set it at 50% opacity when I sketch.  I also use the grease pencil when I sketch. When inking and coloring, I use the organic inker at 100%.  Other than messing with the opacity and size, I don't change any other settings. In the past, when I have worked traditionally, I have used watercolors, acrylics, colored pencil, and tea. Lately, though, I have become addicted to Copic markers and ink pens. When I sketch, I use Prismacolor Turquoise, 2B and a kneaded eraser on either bristol paper, or illustration board. Q: Do you have a Deviant Art/Tumblr/Pinterest/Instagram etc. Yep, I am EVERYWHERE.  DA:   http://khallion.deviantart.com/ Pinterest:   http://pinterest.com/khallion/ Tumblr:   http://karenhallion.tumblr.com/  Instagram:   http://instagram.com/karenhallionart/ Twitter: @khallion Website:  www.karenhallion.com Q: I am an artist; can you give me any advice? A: I get this one a LOT, and I always try to answer when I can, though sometimes it takes a few days. It's been over 15 years since I graduated from art school, and it has taken a lot of work for me to be able to make a living freelancing. Some of the thing that have helped me, other than hard work and not giving up, are join an artist's group and learning from the talented people in there. Sub work to companies you want to work with, and when it gets rejected, do more work and sub it. Just keep moving forward (advice from Walt Disney). Use social media. Learn the best way to use it, and USE IT. It's free advertising, and it works. Find artists you love, and study what they do, and learn from them. Take advice and critiques, ignore the haters. Draw what you love, not necessarily what you think will sell. Help out other artists when you can. Q: Do you take commissions? A: No, unfortunately between my freelance work and other projects, I am unable to take commissions at this time. Q: I have other questions! A: Well, then email us! :)  [email protected]"},

Ciò che porto sul canale \" Sabaku no Maiku \" sono  due contenuti principali :  enciclopedie tecnico-narrative  (includendo quindi approfondimenti completi sia sul gameplay e produzione, che ambientazione e suo folklore) su specifici titoli, con una forte enfasi sull'estetica e la post-produzione della componente video,  e critica videoludica .  Approfondendo, mi impegno a ciarlare il più possibile nei riguardi di una presente ed il più ricercata possibile critica ed informazione nei confronti dell' industria  che produce questo medium e lo porta al consumatore, con l'obiettivo che facendolo si porti sia intrattenimento per l'appassionato che ama sentir discuterne, sia un po' di coscienza e consapevolezza da parte di chi vive quest'hobby, me compreso. Quindi discussione, informazione e guida all'acquisto formata da  first looks  e talvolta  recensioni , ove cerco di renderMi il più utile possibile attraverso la mia esperienza e competenze, delle quali non ci si deve mai accontentare: non si smette mai di studiare, ragazzi, ed anche se i videogiochi nascono come puro e prezioso (unico) intrattenimento, vi è molto da  non  prendere alla leggera, anzi. Sono poi presenti due canali secondari:  -  Sabaku no Pureeyaa , ove si videogioca creando contenuti meno impegnati ma con una \"morale\" alle spalle, e... -  Sabaku no Sutoriimaa , un canale di streaming su Twitch, in cui si affrontano Talk Show/Let's Play e serate post-orario di lavoro insieme. }°{ Come utilizzo il denaro che mi donerete? Youtube monetizza (in Italia  relativamente   poco  rispetto a molti altri paesi) i contenuti, ma è una piattaforma che basa se stessa sulla  quantità:  comunque la si voglia vedere, quantità. Quello che faccio, a livello economico,  è stupido . Youtube non ama video a cadenza lenta o che siano lunghi, ed oltretutto il mio lavoro richiede  dozzine  di ore di lavoro per ciascuna pubblicazione.  Non è qualcosa di sostenibile rispetto alle \"regole\" del sito. In passato ognuno di essi richiedeva mesi per la produzione, le vostre donazioni mi permettono non solo di dedicarmi full-time a questo, ma di evolverlo ed elevarlo a progetti molto più complessi e completi. In altre parole: Acquisire qu alità tecnica e contenutistica  in  costante upgrade : risoluzione/framerate, estetica e strumenti di lavoro professionalmente dignitosi. Acquistare  hardware,   software e conseguenti plugins  di post-produzione come \"tools\" specifici aggiornati anno dopo anno. Assumere  artisti  quali  disegnatori ,  animatori ,  musicisti . Permettere l'ignoramento delle meccaniche commerciali, per produrre contenuti complessi e completi, piuttosto che rapidi e veloci. Permettermi di ignorare numerose tipologie di sponsorship invasive. Conclusioni? Aprire le porte a strumenti avanzati nelle mani di un ex-professionista può valere non poco, e per quanto continui a studiare per evolvere a priori come content creator e critico, il supporto datomi da tutti coloro che vogliono parteciparvi mi ha permesso di portare il canale ed il suo contenuto ad un livello considerevolmente più alto rispetto a ciò che era possibile prima del crowdfunding. L'obiettivo è  sempre  trasformare un canale video in un centro culturale e punto di riferimento per l'appassionato, un portale universale sul Videogioco attraverso essi stessi come il loro mercato ed industria. ...E, quindi, semplicemente permettermi di continuare su questo percorso, sul quale scommetto. Il contenuto che mi permettete di realizzare sarà  sempre gratuito e sempre disponibile a tutti , ed in questa pagina posso solo che  ringraziarvi  attraverso ulteriori approfondimenti ed anteprime, oltre che un contatto lavorativo diretto.

Here's what some of my Patrons have had to say about my content;  Three Red Kings has been a revelation for my understanding of and love for rugby. Tom's analysis is insightful and incredibly well researched. I look forward to his content every week leading up to and after Munster and Ireland games. My habit now for every match is to have one eye on the TV and one on Three Red Kings' Twitter feed. You're guaranteed good craic and banter as well as genuine discernment. Eoin Madigan I used to buy a newspaper a few times a week for no other reason than to get rugby content. It was useless and 99% was rehashed cliches. I used to read niche online forums; they were full of childish wind-ups. Three Red Kings sits in such a sweet spot. It gives me a narrow focus of analytical content for Munster and Ireland without diving into much of the nonsense you get with bloggers. I now spend just €2 on my rugby content a month rather than €2 for a daily newspaper. Donal Treacy   TRK offers the best Munster and Ireland analysis out there, all for the price of a bad cup of coffee each month. Twitter, TikTok, Instagram you name it, TRK has got you covered. David Reidy Absolutely brilliant content. The insight and analysis is top class and perfect for the casual or die-hard rugby fan. Service worth every penny and a whole lot more. Living in Dublin @Threeredkings really helps me stay connected to the Munster team. It's no-nonsense and fair analysis. @Threeredkings is a ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Anthony Barrett Thanks to every single TRK fan and patron that contributes to the site - you allow me to keep doing what I'm doing and for that, I'll be forever grateful to each and every one of you.

I’m so glad you are here. This is a new and exciting adventure for me. A way to connect us all in a more meaningful way. A way to create together. A spot where I can keep you informed of all of the exciting things that I’m building for us. A safe space to dialogue. A community of badasses. And a way for you to support my work so that I can do even more in service to a just world!   What’s my story? My name is Shannon Downey, but I’m better known as Badass Cross Stitch. I am a queer art activist that lives full-time in my RV traveling the United States (and hopefully the rest of the world when the borders open back up) in an attempt to know everyone and trick people into hanging out with me by teaching them how to embroider – BUT really what I’m doing is getting them to have hard conversations with strangers around political and social issues. Then I listen, figure out what barriers exist to them taking more action on these issues, solve for those barriers, and cheerlead them on their path as activists!  So tricky right? You can learn more here:  www.BadassCrossStitch.com Well now I am building a digital community space for us. I’m sick of the social media game where they get to determine who sees or does not see what I’m putting out there for you. Plus, this will build in a way for you to support the work that I’m doing, get even more involved, and connect and build relationships with other community members! So, in service to all of us I have created –   Badass United – so that I can maximize impact and ensure that you all can opt in and know about everything that is going on so you don’t miss anything. AND I have like a zillion new ideas that I will now have time to actually implement and get in front of you!   What is patreon? Basically, it’s both a community space for us that I manage and a way for community to support my work so that I can keep doing it. It allows me to create for you and with you. Like everything I have been doing for years but now in this handy digital space.  It is built on a monthly subscription process – which is going to be GREAT because then we don’t have to one-off everything. If you are team  Badasses United  – you are in for all of the stuff. Workshops, trainings, patterns, events, lectures, projects, stitch-ups, and everything else I come up with from this point on. And there will be special events, gifts, and surprises just for the Badass United community.   It also has the added benefit of being a closed community so y’all can have in depth and meaningful conversations and discussions and I am hoping it cuts down on some of those pesky death threats I get each week.  I have six support levels and like everything I do it’s a bit of a pay-what-you-can model. Every level has access to all of the goods. I have included some add-ons for the higher levels, but no one is going to miss out on anything I’m building. Here’s a video by Patreon that explains further. What sort of stuff have we been doing together? Prior to the great sickness (I am so sick of having to say that), I was hosting hundreds of community stitch-ups, workshops, and art interventions. These were spaces for folks to get together, meet new people, learn to embroider, discuss issues of importance, and connect while enjoying a new hobby. I was pretty devastated when I set off in my RV with over 100 events planned and boom…global fucking pandemic. Obviously, all of those events were cancelled, and I had to pivot. That said, pivot I did! I actually had an amazing year of community building and engagement. Some highlights: Over 5,000 of you from around the world learned to embroider with me via Zoom Hundreds of you have attended my weekly Sunday stitch-ups and built amazing friendships…and we are now plotting how to buy a compound and all live together Over 10,000 of you participated in the January  Make Don’t Break  initiatives and developed a daily making practice 500 of you went through a Bystander Intervention Training 75 of my favorite Introverts and Highly Sensitive People took the Activism 101 workshop build just for you 500 of you attended the first Disrupting Craftivism Panel Discussion We celebrated Bob Ross, Phyllis LaTour Doyle, and Mister Roger’s birthday together in costume and with cocktails  And we are deep in planning for the launch of not one but two Craftivist-In-Residence programs in the United States!  Personally, I’ve traveled to 26 states in my RV and parked in many of your driveways and we managed to display Rita’s Quilt in 6 of those states in covid-friendly ways I’ve done 40 lectures for youth, colleges, libraries, and guilds And recently I’ve finally been able to do some outdoor stitch-ups and actually meet some of you IN PERSON which is the highlight of my life. That’s a hell of a pandemic year y’all. YOU ARE AWESOME. The good news is – I have endless ideas for us. I have more resources, more things to bring you, and more ways for you to get involved in the work and the movements. So much fun will continue to be had! I am excited to report that things are being planned and this coming year will see in person events and gatherings. This space will ensure that when I come through your town we can actually hang out! Or even better, we can plan shit together. What are we going to do together moving forward? My work is in service to you and a just world. Supporting the work means creating more resources and opportunities for you and for us to take action and grow. Community first. Here’s some of the things we will do within the Patreon community: Stitch-ups Community projects Guest speakers Craftivism panels Radical skill share trainings Art challenges Activism challenges Tutorials Free patterns Art + prize raffles And a million more things as I think of them! New for 2022 This year, I will be dropping a new video stitch tutorial every Saturday for the whole year! You can learn 52 different stitches. There will be samplers + stitch-ups + workshops to support your progress. This is going to be exciting!!! In closing You are a badass. I am a badass. Let’s be badasses together! Hit me up with any questions or ideas. <3 Shannon @BadassCrossStitch"},

Researching,\nrecording and editing each episode requires a great deal of work, but it's the\none kind of work we don't procrastinate on. It's an art project, it's an\nintellectual mission, it's a spiritual trip, it's what we love doing the most,\nand we want to keep doing it for as long as we still have something to\nsay.  \n \nSo we hope that you'll jump on board with us,\njoin us on our travels, and help us get to wherever it is we're going.

We do the weird stuff.  This Patreon is dedicated to our regular output, which, as of now, is 70% our lewd femboy game,  Tales of Androgyny  - and 30% other lewd images and stories featuring men, women (with or without dangly bits), and various androgynous and feminine characters that run the gamut of femboys, futa, and other, well, androgynous characters.  There's a lot of focus on curves, colors, and colons.   Below we have the features of our Patreon laid out - we've also got our reward tiers listed out on the right-hand panel for your perusing pleasure.  We have  four  updates every month, more or less guaranteed - full color pictures, story chapters, or game updates.  You can restrict  how many updates you support , so it is flexible. Tales of Androgyny Tales of Androgyny  is our homegrown roguelite femboy and futa-focused game.  You can read an up-to-date description of it (and try the public build)  here .  We're hoping to make a game that's not only erotic, but also has rich, fun gameplay that rewards players for creative thinking, and makes sex part of the game design, rather than auxiliary to it, or vice versa.  It'll be highly replayable, with multiple gameplay modes, character customization, challenges and procedural generation of adventurers, and, down the road, mods and custom content.  There will be a story mode with a central narrative, but the full game mode will be focused on challenging, well-designed gameplay. The featured kinks are, in order of prevalence (kind of): femme boys, women with dongs, domination/submission, monster girls (also often with dongs), humiliation and femdom, particularly pegging of various varieties, plenty of anal, oral, descent into hedonism and depravity, knotting, corruption, giantesses, amazons, thick and curvy women, monsters, facials and bukkake, oviposition, sliiiiiimes and googirls, and many more. Some of the more extreme kinks have toggles to protect delicate eyes and sensibilities, but you wouldn't use those, would you? Patrons are able to vote on the assets that will make it into the game sooner, if at all - this includes encounters/events, characters, animations, and possibly even whole storylines and game modes. These are monthly surveys that are sent out to patrons of the required tiers, and votes are tallied based on tier and updates supported. The Dropbox Gallery If you are a new patron and you want access to the Dropbox: check our post feed and look for the tag \"Dropbox\" - the most recent posts with the appropriate links should be up top.  If you receive an email containing the links and they don't work, make sure to search for those posts, as they may have been edited after the email was sent.  If you can't find the links, please message us directly via Patreon's \"Send Message\" functionality, rather than making a new post on the public feed! Thank you! While most of our work is publicly accessible, works in progress and works that never make it to a finished, public-facing venue are all compiled here on our Dropbox.  As of December of 2016, it will include effectively all of our collected works since we started.  Depending on your reward tier, you may also have access to our raw PSD/SAI files and any HiRes pngs or jpegs of our released work (Bunny Tier+) or alternates that were done for works that are completed (Dragon Tier+), as well as downloads of our recorded livestreams (Dragon Tier+), among other things.  Starting in November of 2016, you'll also have access, again depending on tier, to our patron-only builds of  Tales of Androgyny , including a monthly build (Pony Tier+), and weekly builds (Bunny Tier+). *Access to the dropbox folders and their respective passwords for the month are sent out the day after Patreon processes pledges, and is sent to all processed patrons.  To prevent abuse, we don't send out the links when you first subscribe, only when the first payment is processed!  If you're declined during that processing, send us a message via Patreon once it goes through so that we can send you the links!*  Some alternate-request examples for Angel tier and up:\n\t \n \n \n \n\tAnd come join us on our stream: \n\t https://picarto.tv/Majalis! Disclaimer The themes present in our work, whether it's our art, our stories, or  Tales of Androgyny ,  are purely for erotic purposes. They don't represent our views on actual people, or how sex should occur in real life. We try to be sparing in our use of slurs and language that is meant to demean or dehumanize people - but fetishes being what they are, they do crop up from time to time, and they are meant purely for the enjoyment of the reader. Just as we wouldn't condone real violence, despite the game featuring swords and spears, we do not condone the sexually predatory nature of some characters that feature in our work, nor do we think that their natures endorse real-world equivalents. Our intention isn't to paint any group of people in a negative light - men, women, or anyone of any other gender identity.  If you feel harmed or maligned by our work, please don't hesitate and feel free to reach out to us at  [email protected]  so that we can try to avoid making others feel that way in the future.  Thank you, and don't let anyone tell you your feelings don't matter. Whether you choose to pledge or not Either way, thanks for even considering us!  ♥♥♥ "},

My name is Shing Yin Khor, and I'm a  cartoonist, installation artist , and creator of immersive experiences and keepsake games. I make art, in several different mediums, around immersive narratives of collecting and categorizing, the immigrant memory of nostalgic Americana, new ritual and divinations, and awkward human emotions. I am especially interested in stories at the intersection of race, gender, and the immigrant diaspora. You can find out more about my work, and read many of my comics, on my  portfolio . \n\t \n\tBecoming one of my patrons will give you a look into my process and work, including my weird tangents, my failures and disappointments, and my strange experiments. I look forward to showing you all of the things I love playing with. I make a lot of art(I have a short attention span), and I am constantly looking for ways to integrate activism and play into my work. \n\t  \n\tHere are my current and recently completed projects, that Patreon helped to fund! \n\t \n \n Immersive Installation Art, and Keepsake Games: \n Salvage Station No. 8  was built in collaboration with Beam Camp, a summer camp that teaches kids how to build things! It was an immersive installation featuring multiple rooms and really detailed props and ephemera contributed by over 100+ adults and kids. \n \nThe Last Apothecary  is an immersive haunted house space apothecary installation. It is a narrative about an outer colony space apothecary obsessed with Old-Earth, and also about the persistence of ritual, the space immigrant diaspora, and the obsessive nature of archiving and collecting. It was installed at Burning Man 2016. \n \n Specimens  is an ongoing sculptural series, including curiosity cabinets and displays, and a photographic series of strange beasts in the wild, photographed in national parks across America. The Gentle Oraclebird  is a kind and gentle fortune telling system that performs in unexpected places. \n A Mending  is a solo story-building and keepsake game about two friends who have been parted for some time, using sewing, embroidery, and map-marking mechanics.  Field Guide to Memory , with Jeeyon Shim, is a solo journalling keepsake and connected path game about legacy, wonder, cryptids and the vastness of a human life. \nComics and Illustration: \nThanks to my Patreon subscribers, most of my comics are available for free by default. In addition, I frequently post smaller autobiographical comics as Patreon exclusives.  \n Curiosity Americana  is a series at Catapult where I explore icons, roadside attractions, and various objects of Americana as part of my effort to find and assert my place as an immigrant within this country’s mythos. \n Center for Otherworld Science  is an ongoing comic about interpersonal relationships in a  cryptozoological institute. \n Tiny Adventure Journal  is a travelogue comic. It's where I document my love for cheap travel, weird museums, national parks, Paul Bunyan statues, abandoned places, most animals that are not ostriches, and odd Americana.  \n Resist : A collection of art released for free(under a Creative Commons license) around the theme of political resistance. All pay-what-you-can proceeds go to a non profit working to overturn discriminatory and unconstitutional restrictions on immigration in the United States. \n \n Experimental Art and Art Activism: \nPatreon supports a lot of work that I do not get paid for. Some of this involves my silly and playful experimental tech art, such as the  TenderDnD  Twitter bot, which populates a world full of kind, queer and gentle characters and NPCs. Other projects include the  Gentle Oraclebird bot , and my  shitty fortune generator ! It also funds Space Gnome Mercantile, a trade-by-mail program for my Patreon subscribers. It has also allowed me to work on endurance art projects like painting the Statue of Liberty 40 times in 10 hours to raise money for the ACLU, and  #resistancecranes , in collaboration with two dear friends of mine, where we've raised $20,000 for the National Immigration Law Center, RAICES and International Rescue Committee by folding 1000 cranes in 24 hours in 2017 and 2018. I am also a co-founder of  Project Pizza , with my friend Eron Rauch, which has raised over $18,000 over three years for a local food non-profit, Food Forward. Sometimes, this work leads to some accidental fundraising, like the almost $200,000 I raised for voting rights organizations in Georgia with this  Four Seasons Total Landscaping Gritty T-Shirt . \n \n About the Rewards: \n \n The Dustbear Quarterly: A thoughtfully curated quarterly box of the work I’ve been doing that season, which will usually include zines, limited edition prints, postcard sets, new pins and other merch, other experimental art or delightful objects, as well as longer graphic novels and other projects I’ve been working on. It also includes: A quarterly letter explaining what I’ve been up to, what I am thinking about, and the ups and downs of my life as an artist who's trying their best. Everything in the MAIL DAY subscription(sent monthly, and separately)! \n \n The MAIL DAY Subscription: \nThis subscription means that you will receive flat objects in the mail, including postcards, strange games or divinations, and/or limited prints, sent to you in the mail on a monthly basis, as they are made. These may include small notes telling you what I’ve been doing, little encouragements for your day, Oraclebird fortunes, one page games, or messages from gnomes or fish. \n Every now and then, this subscription converts to a limited time epistolary short story delivery with an ongoing narrative that spans 3-6 months. "},

Because I was limited financially early in my art career and went through a time of being a single mother, with three boys, I decided that if I became successful in my artistic goals I would \"give back\" to those who may have circumstances like mine. The Monet Cafe' YouTube channel now has over 63,000 subscribers from all over the world, and the Monet Cafe' Art Group on Facebook has over 15,000 members. I'm so blessed to experience the beauty of how such a diverse group of people can share their artistic passions in such a loving and giving way.  It's always my goal to bring FREE tutorials, but of course it is time consuming and the cost of video equipment and supplies can get expensive. I have been providing the free tutorials on YouTube for nearly 6 years, and I am so blessed that many of you are now sharing that you would like to support my efforts to continue this free service, and Patreon is a safe and easy way to do that. My art instruction leans heavily toward the medium of soft pastels, as I have fallen in love with this medium; however, I often add mixed media to my creations and also love watercolor, gouache, acrylics and more.  What you can expect: Free Tutorials on the Monet Cafe' YouTube Channel:  I am starting to offer more BEGINNER lessons that have been highly requested. These videos will take you through the very basics of good composition, color theory, materials, and as always, affordable ways to create art on a budget.  For Patreon Subscribers:  1. Special Behind-the-Scene content not offered on the YouTube Channel (product reviews, studio tips and more) 2. Story Time: This is a fun weekly lesson where I read from my favorite art books, give my input and tips and often give a tutorial as well.  3. Extra Real-Time Content and Commentary: Patrons will gain access to the full video tutorials not available on the Monet Cafe' channel.  4. Art Quizzes: This is a patron favorite! I often give a color tests and exercises that will help to hone your artistic skills.  5. Homework Album: My patrons can submit their paintings (from any tutorial or lesson) to our shared Homework Album. This is a great way for me to see your progress and for the group to enjoy and offer encouragement.  6. Facebook Group just for my Patrons: My patrons are eligible to be members of my private FB group where we share art and conversation together.  7. Access to my Private DISCORD Server:  Discord is such a great platform for live chatting and conversation. My Discord page has multiple categories from: \"What's on Your Easel\" to \"Music to Paint by\". It's a fun and engaging way to share art and make friends.  WHEW!! That was a lot, but believe it or not there's more. That should give you an idea though of the fun and learning you can experience as a patron.  Keep in mind: There is no long term commitment necessary here on Patreon!  You can join for as long as you like or just for a while. I feel humbled and blessed to have experienced art through such an amazing artistic family from all over the world! Thank you in advance for your cherished support.  Blessings! Susan Jenkins"},

I'm Philip and I welcome you to my Patreon page! I'm a professional illustrator and artist and I love creating environments and landscape illustrations. To put it simply on how Patreon works:  As I have two tiers, you can choose which tier suits you most. If you're just looking for my high quality artwork JPEGS, then the  VISIONARY  tier will be fit for you. If you're wanting to learn and get access to tutorials and process videos + more, then the  MYTHIC  tier will be best as this tier includes all my available content and resources.  Please note that you will be charged your pledge amount upon joining, then a monthly charge of your pledge amount on the same day of the next month. I use Adobe Photoshop as my preferred software but my techniques and methods within my tutorials and process videos can be followed using other similar drawing softwares! Because I mainly use layers, clipping masks, brush/eraser tools and no special tricks (all of which are available across a wide range of drawing softwares) it won't be an issue to follow along even if you use Procreate, Clip Studio etc. --------------------------------------------------- Monthly Exclusive Patreon Tutorials:  Every month, my patrons will submit ideas of the tutorial they'd like to see. Then I will compile a list and go through a poll to decide which idea gets voted most on. If you tutorial gets lots of votes but doesn't make it, don't worry, it can be on the next month's tutorial or a new poll. These exclusive tutorials will usually get released near the end of the month - there will also be a download link for these sent out to you via Patreon messages at the start of the new month after pledges in the new month are collected. All Content:  I will be uploading content on here every week, which consists of process videos, layered Photoshop files, high-quality wallpapers and my brushes. These are all available for you to watch through here on Patreon and you will also get access to watch every single video I have ever uploaded. --------------------------------------------------- With your support through Patreon,  I can focus more of my time into creating more personal illustrations and sharing educational content with you. It is my ultimate goal to freely create work that I love, to inspire others and to pass on the knowledge I gain to others so they too can create beautiful artwork. However way you choose to support me I honestly thank you from the bottom of my heart. I want to thank you for your interest and taking the time to read this! :) I appreciate YOU and your support! Hoping to connect with you soon through my art! <3"},

I leave the logic of streets and pavement and cars and tall buildings behind and buy into the old magics that they're whispering about. Sometimes those little mysteries and bits of wisdom stick to the bones of my head and I carry them right out into the sunlight again.  (from  Someplace to Be Flying ) I’ve been writing full-time for more years now than I can remember and consider myself extremely lucky to be able to do just that. With my wife MaryAnn at my side we’ve been able to pay the bills with our indie-produced books. But lately, with MaryAnn’s debilitating illness taking a chunk out of my time and *all* of her time, it’s taking much longer to get books edited, proofed, cover art done and just written. Unfortunately, the bills keep rising, ignoring how circumstances are at the moment. They don’t, as my musician friend Brock Zeman says in one of his songs, give a good goddamn. So I’ve come to Patreon. What will you get by supporting me here? Portions of forthcoming novels, unpublished stories, some songs, some poems, some art, some pictures of our pup Joey Strummer, possibly some deleted scenes or unfinished material. The books and stories will eventually appear elsewhere but you’ll get to read and enjoy them long before anyone else. I’m hoping your patronage will give me some breathing room as I care for MaryAnn and tell more stories. And I’m hoping that we can build a community."},

This is a home for conversations with other fans, other artists, and friends. There will be ongoing videos of my touring life.  A Podcast, tour blog, discounts on merch, interviews, new songs, archival songs, special events and more! And you will see the creative process up close for any new songs, stories, videos, or artwork that I'm creating  as it's being made--   right here, from my home, from the road, from the stage! Your  membership  allows another, even more personal creative outlet to share my work with you. Despite a global pandemic, this site has helped me to thrive and survive as an artist from home for the first time in 30 years. I eventually will be touring, on the weekends, and will be providing you with a backstage look at that as well. The added funding here will allow me to pay for management, manufacturing of new art, books and music. It helps with road expenses and takes the pressure off being away from home and my kids. This Patreon home is the fruition of the idea that my career has evolved into a  little media company.  It's no longer solely about being a traveling songwriter. I want to continue to write songs, write books, do art, and teach other artists. But I'm realizing I can do that right here as well, and maybe more effectively.  I’m working to build the next chapter of my career, but I want your involvement in doing it.

I went to art college for a year in the late 1970s, and although I dropped out before the end of the course, it taught me a lot of techniques, basics and a way of thinking about art that I have drawn on over the years to experiment with sketching, drawing & illustration, simple printmaking and a few graphic design commissions.  I was recently honoured to be in the shortlist of 42 out of over 8,500 entries for the Jackson's Painting prize 20121 in the Spring. Congratulations to all the worthy winners! I decided to set up a Patreon account in order to continue to build on the demonstration videos and tutorials that I publish on my YouTube channel 'Lois Davidson' as I continue with my new career as a full time artist. YouTube videos are posted a bit early on Patreon, and can be viewed there advert free, I also post exclusive Patreon tutorials at least twice a week, either in-depth multi-part versions of the short YouTube videos showing just about every brush stroke, or Patreon exclusives with lots of tip s and techniques and plenty of ref. photos and templates to copy, download etc.  Every month or two I set up a specific post where Patrons can request tutorials on things like dry brush technique, moonlight, Scottish castles, line and wash etc, which means that if you have problems in certain areas of landscape painting, I can usually make up a tutorial to explore the issue, although I may not be able to cover all requests, some will be unsuitable for my style of painting. I have also created an exclusive Facebook group for members to share their artwork and chat, as soon as you subscribe to Patreon you will get details as to how to join the group, we have a wonderful community there! So if you think you'd like to join us, and support me, I'd love to see you here :-) Thanks so much and Happy Painting!"},

I paint the traditional way, with paint and water on wood panels by hand. I paint all the time, and began the official Strangeling brand and website with my painting career as a teenager online back in 1997.  Lots of beautiful big eyed girls, faeries, mermaids, pop surrealism, new gothic art, new contemporary, magic realism, lowbrow and highbrow, fantasy art and such.  If you have ever visited a Disney themepark, browsed through an art magazine, bought something from the Bradford Exchange, hung out at comic conventions, been to a faerie festival, colored coloring books, collected enamel pins, stumbled across my   1.6 Million Fans on Facebook , or visited my  Strangeling.com  website you are probably familiar with my work.  I hope you enjoy it, and if you don't - just stick around, I'm always painting more.  I joined Patreon to create a space for myself and for my fans, collectors and patrons to connect and interact in a way beyond that of existing social media.  Patreon is where you will find exclusive content unavailable anywhere else, the home of my Strangeling Pins subscription club, advance notifications and sneak previews, views of my daily life through my eyes via frequent Patreon Lens snippets, tutorials and live painting, a lot of \"Behind the Scenes\" content, and depending on what patronage tier you subscribe to - even get \"first dibs\" and \"reservations\" on original paintings and hard-to-get Masterpiece Editions.  Here we have the  Patreon Pin Collector Tier  is where you receive Patreon Exclusive pins, new Pins of the Month each month and more!   And yes, I am the artist who has voluntarily relinquished many of my copyrights to the Public Domain,  so if you are looking for her, I am she and you have come to the right place!  For the initial release of the \"Project 625\" high resolution files - scans of 625 original acrylic paintings for your unlimited personal or commercial use - those are available at  https://downloads.strangeling.com   - if you enjoy getting the free stuff faster and have new images available for your use before the general public gets the opportunity, definitely join me here at Patreon even the $1 tier and you're in!  We also welcome corporate and commercial partners - if you're doing something cool with my artwork, and you're feeling generous enough to throw a percentage or make a public pledge, I'd love to support you back and spread the word and work together to get my artwork out to the people who love it.  And no, there are no strings attached, I hate being strung along too.

FAQ This FAQ is for my specific Patreon page and program.  If you have questions about Patreon in general, questions about billing, payments, software, what patronage is, etc. please also visit the official  Patreon Help Center here   (Scroll DOWN past the FAQ to get to the different reward tiers) Q:  How much does it cost? A:  Depending on what tier you subscribe to, anything from $1/month + Q:  What does my money go for? A:  Your money goes specifically to supporting my artwork.  This Patreon program is specifically to offset the costs of running my art career, keeping my website and other content \"ad-free,\" paying for bandwidth necessary to give my artwork away to the world and anybody else who wants it, inevitable legal fees, paying the Strangeling staff members, providing salaries to our Strangeling team members, my art supplies, paying utilities and rent for our offices and studios, website administration, and (very importantly) travel expenses so I can come & do art shows, meet my fans, etc.   To see my upcoming schedule of events -   Click HERE for upcoming Strangeling Events .   Q:  But don't all the big companies and galleries pay you to come out and have shows? A:  No.  Even if it's a free autograph event halfway around the world where all I do is meet fans for 45 minutes, all travel costs (and hotels, food, etc.) pretty much always come from my own pocket.  I do it because I love it and I love to meet my fans, supporters and friends.  It is pretty much always at a tremendous financial loss.  Patreon can help me offset these costs, and help make it possible for me to come out and see you all more often, I want to travel to more places with my artwork! Q:  So you really get to do what we want with the scans of your public domain paintings?  Even if we're only at the $1 level?   A: Yes - everybody can, I have given them to the public.  And you Patrons are extra special since you gave me a dollar - you get to download new ones before the muggles do, and loads more perks besides. Q:  So are you not going to post so much at Facebook, Instagram, etc.? A:  I sure am, just as I always do, don't worry!  Patreon however will always include ADDITIONAL content that is not going to be available at other sites.  Here you can see Patreon Lens videos I post throughout the day (use the free Patreon App - it's the best for watching Lens!) at home or on the road, at the easel or playing with the cats.  I keep y'all posted here when I get news, and show you behind-the-scenes stuff I'm not comfortable posting publicly.  On my Patreon posts page I preview paintings, announce projects and show off works-in-progress here BEFORE I do so to the general public.  That's part of what you get in exchange for even the smallest token of support, and I thank you dearly. Q:  What is \"Behind the Scenes\" content? A:  This is fun stuff from me, not always very professional, lol, that I don't bother sharing on other sites. I  post personal daily videos (often several times a day) with my Patreon Lens (accessible to ALL Patrons $1+, with additional content included in the $5+ tiers).  Timelapse videos of paintings from start-to-finish. Livestreams & snippets from my vacations and events, pics from my studio, pictures of me & my cats, pictures of projects I'm working on, pictures of us getting ready to set up our shows and events.  Personal insights that the general public wouldn't probably appreciate, but that you yourself might find interesting!   Q:  What is \"Top Secret\" content, and is it really secret? A:  Top Secret really is top secret.  It is for the $50+ tier.  In fact, once you join the tier we will have a short \"NDA\" (Non-Disclosure Agreement) that you will need to agree to.  This is for serious collectors.  This will be the first showings of works-in-progress, and those in the Top Secret tier will thus be the first people to get \"first dibs\" on my infamous First Dibs list.  At that time as well, those in the Top Secret tier can also pre-order Limited Editions / Masterpiece Editions before the general public, which can be crucial.  The Top Secret content will also include full previews of finished original paintings whenever possible before art shows open, which can be a wonderful bonus for those still not having decided on a piece based on the work-in-progress pics.  I will also use the Top Secret content feed to first announce new shows, private projects, pre-orders for new books, stuff not yet suitable for public consumption, etc. Q:  How does the 10% OFF discount work? A:  The 10% OFF discount (available for those in the $10+ tier) is for my website, Strangeling.com (not eBay, not Amazon, not StrangelingUK, not Disney World, only Strangeling.com - but we are working to expand the discount to more Strangeling sites & partners). Shortly after joining this tier, we will contact you with your discount code.  You can use this discount code over & over again, as long as your Patreon membership on my page is viable.  You will need to use the same email address when placing an order with the discount code at Strangeling.com as you do on Patreon (otherwise contact us via Patreon and Jenn or Sonya will hook you up). Q:  What do I get 10% OFF of? A:  You can get 10% off of anything at Strangeling.com - paper prints, Collectible Metal Enamel Pins, Open Edition Canvas prints, Canvas Cuties, Original Sketch Cards, Masterpiece Limited Edition Canvas prints, or even Original Paintings (if I don't sell them off to you Patrons before I finish them, lol).  If you even occasionally buy prints, this is an excellent deal for only the $10 tier.  If you were to buy at $595 Masterpiece for example, you'd save almost $60 alone! Q: How does the Pin Collector Tier work? A:  It's one of the best things about Patreon!  Only $25/month for our original members (new members later in 2022 may have to join the New Pin Collector Tier at $35 depending on membership slots available).  If you collect pins, sign up as soon as you can, it is well worth it.  Firstly - you'll get the current Patreon Exclusive Pin (we issue a handful of those each year), not available for sale anywhere else.  Throughout the year, we release additional Patreon Exclusive pins, and whenever we do you'll get those too.  You'll also get items like Strangeling custom pin lanyards.  And of course your initial signup includes the current Strangeling Pin of the Month, and also the official Strangeling Logo Pin.  Each and every month you'll get the Pin of the Month (usually shipped around the 10th of that month) automatically!  Not only that, you get 10% off any pins you buy from Strangeling.com (and prints, canvases or any other artwork too!).  All shipping worldwide is included.  You also get everything that the $10 Patreon level gets, sneak previews, behind the scenes content, early works-in-progress, etc.   If you join the $50+ Tier, in addition to everything above, you'll ALSO be guaranteed to automatically receive one of each of any new/upcoming \"Limited Edition Mini Metal Pin Sets\" (usually $39.99 each) which we issue every few months, and will also receive one of the \"Mystery Pin Sets\" (usually $39.99 each) whenever those are launched at Strangeling.com (depending on inventory we do this a few times a year and they always sell out immediately).  This will save you the awful rush and worrying about hitting refresh when the big releases happen, and of course it'll save you money too ;) Q:  Who told you about Patreon? A:  The wonderful and very clever Amanda Palmer.  She recommended it and she has a fantastic Patreon Page too here:   Amanda F Palmer's Patreon   Q: Can I really join at the $1 Million tier? A:  Yes, I would appreciate it very much.  The good folks at Patreon HQ have it set up for me as a real subscription tier, just like the $1 tier. Q: Can I just take your high resolution scans and do what I want with them?  Even print stuff and make stuff and sell it?  Anywhere?  Even if I don't pay you? A:  Yes.  Anybody can.  I've given many of my paintings to the Public Domain.  It took me a long time to paint them all though, so if you honestly can spare a dollar or more and show support here at my Patreon, it will help me paint more paintings for you.  I love painting. Q:  I have other questions! A:  Well, then contact us via the Contact form here at Patreon and let the Strangeling Team answer them for you!"},

My need to bring in an audience and make money has made it difficult to make things I love and care about. I'm dedicated to putting more stock in exciting projects that make fans excited to tune in. Patreon gives me the ability to make a living out of creating without worrying about how I'm going to pay the bills and maintain. Alright Weirdo, But What Do I Get??

Not necessarily gratis, but free to spread, use, and make new art from. Like the fairy tales of old, or folk music, art is at it’s heart a communal effort. It is a way of commununication, not a commodity.  I make art and release it under Creative Commons licenses, so you can use it exactly as you see fit.  As the copyright industries tighten their grip of the internet, infringing on our privacy, our freedom of speech, and our human rights in the process, we as artists need to find new, free ways of distributing our art, that is in line with the nature of art itself. That’s is what I’m trying to do. What is Patreon? Patreon is a crowdfunding service, like Kickstarter or Indiegogo. It allows you to back creators on a regular basis, instead of a onetime sum. I'm asking for monthly donations, to allow me to create even more free content. So, who am I? I’m Kim Holm, an artist from Bergen, Norway, creating art that delves the depths of darkness and sometimes brings up a little light.  I have worked as an illustrator, comic book artist, and teacher, but am now focusing on fine art.  On TikTok I've been creating videos since 2020, with daily ink monsters, mythology, and opinions on art, mental health, and politics, reaching millions of viewers and over 400 000 followers.  I’ve released books, comics, held exhibitions, and am occasionally capturing black metal music from the side of the stage at concerts, having drawn over 2000 live concert drawings, all available for free use. I have worked with bands like Solstafir, Vreid, 1349, Primordial, and many more.  I have worked professionally since 2004, and  my online gallery has over 4 GB’s of art for free use. I am also, like many artists, suffering from depressions and bi-polar disorder. And that’s one of the main reasons I need your help. Over the years I have shown that I’m willing to put in the work, but unfortunately my head doesn’t always play ball, and getting consistency, either it be in comic book projects or social media promotion, has been a huge problem. I'm also a family man, with a wife and two small kids. So everything I do is also for the stability for us all.   So I’m humbly asking for help getting back on my feet, so I can produce even more and better art than already. No matter what, I will never stop making free art.  So what will you use the money on? Everything I get on will go directly into just surviving so that I can produce more art. If I someday get more than I need, it will go into producing more free art in some shape of form.  There are a lot of expenses just hosting hi-resolution art, scanning, photographing art, storage, and not the least materials to make art with.  I will also continue doing exhibitions, selling artwork,  doing work for bands and individuals, so I’m not planning on making Patreon my sole income. But every single dollar I get from here will help me more than you can ever know.  So what’s in it for you, my patrons? Well, I tried having different types of rewards in the past, and that simply didn’t work. So the only reward you get for supporting me is early access to a great deal of work that’s not yet released, and some updates, videos, and exclusive small things once in a while.  If you supported me before 2019¸ and haven’t gotten your physical rewards, contact me and we’ll sort it out. How often will I release art? More and more, that depends. I’ve tried sticking to schedules before, but I can only stick with them for a while before they are broken by one of my depressive periods.  But even through the first years on Patreon, where I was regularly unable to keep my commitments because of depression, I released hundreds and hundreds of artworks for free use. And as I search for more stability, I will continue trying to make even better art.  But copyright? Pirates? Do I hate artists? Not at all. I just think the copyright system has failed. We need a system that protects the consumers, freedom of information, and freedom of speech. We can create a system that pays content creator in a fair way without infringing these rights. And most importantly, I think art itself suffers until we change the system. With copyright, we can nevermore have folk-music, folk-heroes, or folk-art. Art is just a commodity. The system encourages plagiarism, and allows for corporations to steal creative work from their creators. It allows work to fall into obscurity and disappear forever because its owners don't see the value in them. It creates an atmosphere where we are all limit the stories and images and possibilities in our own mind. So, I fight the current system of intellectual property because I love art.  You can't support me, you say? Well, there's other ways to support me as well, such as following me on social media, interacting, liking, sharing, and telling people about my art.  https://www.tiktok.com/@denungeherrholm? www.facebook.com/DUHHfans www.youtube.com/denungeherrholm www.instagram.com/denungeherrholm www.twitter.com/denungeherrholm And most importantly, support my art by using it for your project. Find stuff at  denungeherrholm.smugmug.com  or just ask me if I have anything that fits. "},

I mainly work in the intersection between food and poverty, whether that's creating recipes on shoestring budgets based on my own experiences as a single mum and former food bank user, or writing about current affairs - whether that's food banks, cooking, access to food, prices, farming, etc. Many years ago when I (accidentally) started out as a food writer, several well-meaning people in television or food or books individually took me aside and said 'Jack, you need to choose between being a food writer or being a political campaigner'. Literally a dozen people said this to me in a short period of time. And I refused - because my food writing came from a place of hunger and poverty in one of the richest economies in the world, and I can't detach cheap recipes from the reasons why people need them in the first place. I'd be a much more palatable (and higher earning!) food writer if I just STFU about inequality and injustice, but that's not my style. By supporting my Patreon you're giving me space to create the work that really drives me - the free recipes on my website and allllll the admin work that that entails, the charity work I do for free for dozens of food organisations and NGOs tackling poverty, the school talks, the good stuff that makes a difference but doesn't pay the bills. It's not a donation service, there's a reward at every tier, so it's more like a subscription for some goodies as well as exclusive behind the scenes content, musings, sneak peeks at upcoming bits and pieces, and more. Thanks again - and all my love, Jack Monroe.

I am an illustrator that enjoys  drawing and making cute stuff \n\tThrough patreon I would like to make a small community for people that enjoy my artwork while at the same offering designs exclusive to this club.  By supporting me through patreon I will be able to focus on making more of my own content without having to take on additional side projects. The support from this club will also help me fund more future projects of my own! Leftover items from each month will be added to the secret shop at their\n retail value. People will only be able to purchase them through the \nsecret shop by using the monthly password that I will distribute at the \nfirst of each month alongside the monthly discount code. Passwords and discounts are distributed on the 5th of each month after payments have processed. Thank you if you decide to join!\n\t\t\\(^ヮ^)/\n How my patreon works  Each month there are new designs available for sign up.  For pins tiers you can add a sticker sheet add on for an extra $2. The design will not be the same, it is a different design each month and its usually something from my IG gallery.  Payments are only processed on the 1st of each month so you have a whole month to decide whether to stay or leave.  Payments are processed from the 1st – 5th of each month so do not panic if you do not see a charge yet.  Rewards are shipped out  only when production for them has finished .  On average it usually takes 2 months for production and shipping but sometimes delays may happen.  For pin clubs I’m offering 2 pins for each pin tier (unless you pick combo), there is twice the work so I give myself enough time for packing and shipping.  Originally, I only had one pin per tier and the mini pin was a bonus I had for being late. Now it is a permanent addition in exchange for the longer wait time.  I am not using a fulfillment center nor am I a group of people. It is just me grading and packaging pins so I appreciate the patience! Secret Shop and Discounts  Passwords are sent out on the 5th of each month.  Past rewards are added to the shop but ONLY if I have leftovers.  You can only get fan club pins in the secret shop from now on.  I can not ship to the EU or UK through my main shop (does not affect patreon). I can only through Etsy. There are a lot of inconvenient new laws so aside from enamel pins other items may be hard to get. It is not me making these rules! :U Before joining, please keep these notes in mind! °˖✧ Shipping ✧˖° All tiers have shipping calculated into the price International orders also have tracking but may vary depending on country Goods will be shipped when rewards come in (times may vary) For international orders, in order for me to keep prices low I have opted for a cheaper shipping option .  I have also included $1 insurance for all international packages Please note that I cannot combine patreon orders with shop orders. Unfortunately it can get very confusing if I hold onto orders for too long."},

My name is Emma Carlisle and I'm an illustrator living in the South West of England. I'm sure most of you have found this Patreon page via my Instagram account where I share my love of sketchbooks, landscape paintings and life drawing - Hello! Welcome! Nice to meet you! I've been posting on Instagram for nearly 10 years however since the start of 2018 I've been using it to document my creative journey as I've transitioned away from picture books and towards a more experimental approach to image making. I gave myself time to develop as an artist and it's been the most rewarding and healing experience. Instagram has been the perfect place for me to document this journey and if you follow me already you'll know I try to be as honest and open as possible, recently I've found myself holding back especially with behind the scenes work, process' and sketchbook tours, there's only so much I can do and only so much time I have which is where I feel Patreon steps in and becomes the prefect complimentary platform for sharing my practice.  The most important thing to me is that I've grown an Instagram following which feels like a community, a space for me to share new work and get instant supportive feedback from what feels like an amazing group of friends (although there's over 55k of you now! eek!) Every comment, like and message gives me the assurance that I'm on the right track (even when I try something completely new) and this has made me feel confident about continuing to develop as an artist.  I feel honored that you follow me on social media and I'm even more so that you've made it this far and are considering backing me on Patreon, seriously, thank you so much!  When I sat down and thought about what I'd like this page to be it was really simple - I wanted to be able to give back some of the support you've given me and help you grow as an artist too, which is why each tier is designed to offer some level of guidance and encouragement. I want us to work together to create something exciting, where we can both share the highs and the lows.

I'm Foxfeather, and I love vultures!  These underrated and unsung heros of the bird world are in serious trouble and I want to help. I'm on a mission to create a vulture-specific center where these magnificent and important birds can be in the spotlight; a hub for education, research, and conservation work. Though I want to focus specifically on vultures, there is such a big need for\n wildlife rescue and rehabilitation services in my area. As a licensed wildlife rehabilitator and conservation educator, I'm \nworking to develop a wildlife rehab center and network in southern \nMinnesota. Foxloft Conservancy, our wildlife rehabilitation and\n education branch, is now a registered 501c3 non-profit organization!  My goal through my art, education, and rehabilitation effort is to help better connect \npeople with and animals and the natural world. Through live shows with our education ambassador birds (like Sev, pictured above) and online events, I hope to inspire a greater interest in conservation and wildlife stewardship; for vultures and all of our wild neighbors. Your patronage allows \nme to do this work; to feed the birds, build facilities, care for wildlife patients, and to offer programs for free to schools and \ncommunity groups in my area. You also get to follow along with the process of developing a wildlife center from the ground up, along with other perks of being a patron!  On top of the wildlife work, I'm also an artist and run a small farm. I'm a beekeeper, falconer, yak-wrangler, and am owned-by-emus. Along with Patreon, you can keep up to date with my adventures on  Twitter  or on my websites,  Foxloft Studios  and  Foxloft Conservancy How Does Patreon Work? Please think of Patreon as a tip-jar or supportive membership service. If you enjoy my work, have laughed at my crazy emu videos, or want to toss the ambassador kestrel, raven, or vultures a mouse, this is a way to show your appreciation and support. Lots of people think wildlife rehab is paid for by the state or \ngovernment; it is not. I am completely reliant on self-funding and \ndonations to pay vet bills, buy medical equipment and specialty diets, \nbuild housing for and spend the time caring for orphaned and injured \nwildlife. You can directly help my work grow and succeed! If you join me as a patron, you get access to my library of posts and articles as well as new ones emailed to you monthly. You can turn these notifications on or off and enjoy them at your leisure.  You can have a direct impact on helping the Vulture Center become a reality!  Patreon offers the ability to become a supporter of the work that you love. By pledging even just $1 a month you can help keep me rescuing wildlife, making new artwork, spreading the word about conservation, and sustainable farming - with additional benefits listed below!  Being a patron gets you access to exclusive work-in-progress artwork and behind the scenes with the animals!  I share lots of stories about what it's like to work with and raise ambassador birds, rescue wildlife, and live with critters around the farm. I'm sharing what it's like to develop shows and programs, care for the outreach animals, and work in wildlife rehabilitation. If you've ever been curious about this work, you're in the right place!  If you'd like to see how some of my art designs are created, from concept to \nfinal design, all levels of patronage offer the chance to see my \nprogress artwork, including sketches and process art as well as a sneak \npeak at the designs I'll be working on before anyone else knows, and early access to fun projects like Kickstarter campaigns. Thank you so much for considering backing my work!  I can't tell you how much it means to me, all the support I've gotten from so many amazing people who have helped me to help animals and to make a career out of doing what I'm passionate about. Thank you for joining me on this journey."},

Ok, so that's how this page used to start... and it was followed by a rather stiff and formal intro of my work. But since you're here, the chances are really high that you already know some aspect of me.  Maybe you know me as the woman who's been teaching BDSM, rope, and D/s classes forever. Maybe you know me for staring ForteFemme. Perhaps you've read an essay or a story by me. Maybe you know me as a crazy cat lady, tea lover, or travel junkie. I am all that... and most of all  I am an artist.  Some of you are familiar with my art. Many of you aren't. I've been creating my whole life... even when I wasn't comfortable calling myself  Artist .  In today's world art is necessary - more than ever... it's part of the alchemy of change that is desperately needed.  Your support through Patreon allows me a bit of ease and room to make art, collaborate and add my blood, sweat and tears to the great tidal force of change.    I've posted my TEDx talk that tells you a bit about my journey as an artist.  == I have a hard time describing my work. I work with any given tools and medium, often in collaboration with other people. If pushed to describe my genre, I'd have describe it as  Social Practice . What exactly is this? I create situations where people get to be part of the creation and expression of complex emotions. The official art bio on  my portfolio site  says: \"Midori is a multidisciplinary artist fascinated with giving shape and texture to emotion, memory, desire, beauty, repulsion, collective memory and subconscious revisions of experience....\" My work is mostly about experiences and interaction. You can see my work at  www.Ranshin.com  Many of my work aren't \"things\" that people can buy and hang on the wall.  It takes a lot of work behind the scenes, then it's done in one night - or a few minutes. Much of this I've been funding myself... Yes, this is nuts and not so smart for a smart gal.  But I'm possessed by an irrational desire to create. And the results have been received really well.  The good news is that more and more of the creative spaces and organizations are giving me the space to engage and create.  But I still have to work really hard with my day job (the teaching) to survive. This means my bandwidth becomes seriously limited for art and creative work. Over the past decade, I've tried to figure out how to carve out more time out of the day.  I've been building fantastic people connections for projects. This has been a blessing. But still I'm facing the truth of physics. Time is finite - and so is my creative bandwidth in this time line.  In order to realize the amazing new things I have planned, I need to be more sustainable. If not, either these projects will never be created for you to enjoy, or I will burnout trying to make something possible.  Neither option is good.   I need help.  Your help.  (Yes, that's me! Image from  \" Hodoku \"  performance at YBCA. See my art at  www.Ranshin.com   Photo by Samar.)  How Does This Work?  Patreon works like this. Folks can donate whatever they want  per month . It's a small recurring amount that you can change any time.  Think of this like buying a cup of java monthly so I can keep focus.  Or maybe you'll grab lunch with me once a month to fuel my crazy creative life.  Why am I doing the per-month model and not the per-thing model?  The way my projects work is months of back work follow by a bang, a big event that I share with the public. This makes it difficult to share each small thing. As many of you are interested in different parts of what I do, I want to leave it up to you to decide how you want to help.  I will be posting special progress reports, videos and insider info in the supporters-only section as I go along.  This means that anything, from $1 per month up, is immensely helpful. Thank you for reading this. I'll be honest - it's been a difficult decision to do this. I've been toughing this out mutting \" I can do this myself. I have health and wits and grit. I can do this without help. \" ... so I used to think. It is humbling to admit that I cannot.  My gratitude to you is deep.  Many of you have been supporting me in so many ways all along.  Thank you.  Just by reading this, you're supporting my spirit, and I am deeply grateful.  But if you do decide to be my patron here, you're gifting me with ways that go far beyond the funds - you are enabling me to share more with you, with the world, through creative passion AND sustainability. with gratitude, love and lunacy, Midori ( Evoco Project   continues.

Hi, I'm Monica! I'm an itinerant writer. I've been making a full-time salary on Patreon since 2016. I use this salary for groceries, rent, transportation, and healthcare. I'll continue to do so for as long as I can, so that, instead of depending on exploitative corporations for my basic needs, I depend on a community of individuals who value creative freedom.  \nWhat have you done with this support? I've written two science fiction novels,  The Girl in the Road  and  The Actual Star . (If you click on those links, you can see the prizes they won, and all the incredibly nice things that critics and fellow authors said about them.) My short stories have been published in  Tor.com ,  The Baffler ,  The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction ,  Shimmer ,  Kaaterskill Basin Journal ,  Outlook Springs ,  Gargoyle ,  Fantasy Magazine ,  and  Electric Velocipede .  I'm also a playwright. As of now, my most-produced play is  What Every Girl Should Know , and my latest play  OHIO!  is set to debut in Melbourne in 2023. I also hosted a  futurist series for ViceUK   and gave the  first science fiction TED Talk .  If you'd like to know more,  here  is my nifty website where you can explore to your heart's content. What's the deal with your tiers? Usually, creators offer bigger rewards at higher tiers. However, in a society with gross wealth inequality, it feels increasingly uncomfortable to me to maintain that model. Rather, I believe that all of us work hard and everyone gives what they can. So: I want every Patreon patron to get everything. In addition, I want most of my work available to those who can't contribute at all--people too young to have a credit card, people who don't have a lot of money, and people who don't have access to U.S. banking. My patrons want that, too, and are graciously willing to subsidize it. \n What if I just want to make a one-time\ndonation, instead? That'd be awesome!

A system where only the biggest of the big bands are able to make a living and the rest of us sacrifice our whole lives and risk financial ruin every step of the way. \n So where to from here? Well, we want to create an interactive fan experience unlike any band that has come before us.  \n We want to help create a path, not just for Ne Obliviscaris, but for the countless bands across the world that are working incredibly hard, touring the world to perform for their fans and losing money every step of the way.  \n And we want to do it by empowering YOU, the fans, so that you get to decide who succeeds and who doesn’t. The old establishment is dying. Let’s show that we can create our own new way forward and put the power back where it should be, with the fans who love and believe in the music that we, and so many great bands out there are creating. \n To start with though, we want to give you guys a bit more background on the reality of our situation, and then we’ll explain exactly how you can get involved in our career in an unprecedented new way.  \n THE EFFECT OF THE INTERNET                                                                                                                          Rather than fight the inevitable change that the industry has had thrust upon it ever since the advent of the internet in the mid 90's, here in NeO we are always embracing new ways forward. NeO first built an underground following across the world in large part due to the benefits of file sharing, torrents, youtube and the internet in general. We didn't have a huge label spending tens of thousands of dollars trying to make us the next big thing; it was a grass roots thing... Fans discovered us, told their friends, discussed NeO on forums; they shared our music with each other and helped spread our music to more and more people over time.  \n The internet has resulted in an industry that actually gives more bands an opportunity to build a decent fanbase, as the music is now available for everyone to listen to anytime they want - for free. Lots of people in the industry refer to the “good old days” when everyone bought albums and many bands made a lot of money, but in some ways, it is much more democratic this way. Instead of it being like the old days where the only bands that could become successful were the one's that had the support of a big label, these days it is YOU, the people out there that decide which bands succeed or fail. The bands that get signed at all are often the ones that have acquired fans at a grass roots level and forced the labels to take notice, not the other way around. That is what happened with NeO and is happening with many other bands.  FINANCIAL REALITIES IN THIS NEW INDUSTRY The one downside is that though a band like us owes much of our popularity to the internet and the way the industry works in 2016, the industry no longer supports bands financially in the way it used to. The harsh reality is that you now have bands that have tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of fans all around the world, and yet still make less than minimum wage. \n We'll level with you...here in NeO we don’t even make that. In fact we have never been paid anything for playing in this band, as the little money we do make gets continually re-invested to finance all our tours rather than paid out to members.  \n The first time we ever made a profit on a tour was our 2014 Citadel Australian Launch tour. All up we made just over $20,000AUD. This was an incredible result for us at the time and it might sound like a lot… Until you realise that since then we have done 3 major international tours lasting between 4 and 7 weeks each, and lost AT LEAST $20,000AUD on every single one of them.  \n \n THE AUSTRALIAN FACTOR Things are tough for bands all across the world right now, but realistically part of this is because we are from Australia. We start every tour having to pay $10-15,000AUD in flights to some far-off part of the world (they all are pretty far off, to be honest...), plus Visa's, Bus Deposits, Merchandise (T-Shirts, Hoodies, CD's, Vinyl etc.) which can still cost many thousands of dollars despite getting them at wholesale price and more. As a result, we may start a tour with over $30,000 in debt, and then hope that we make enough money each day on the tour to start chipping away at this total so that we can afford to do another tour after that one.  TOUR INCOME/EXPENSES BREAKDOWN FOR OUR LAST EUROPEAN TOUR To be more specific, on our Oct/Nov 2015 European Tour with Cradle of Filth our total gross income from Performance Fees and Merchandise Sales for the 33 shows combined was $46,789AUD.  \n Once again, that probably sounds like a lot until you realise that when you add up our international flights, bus hire for 6 1/2 weeks, petrol, tolls, UK Work Visa's, UK wireless permits, Ferries, Merchandise, Booking Agent Fees, Sound Engineer, Backline Hire & more we had more than $67,433AUD in expenses.  \n So the final result from that tour was a LOSS of $20,644AUD ($14,625USD/13,504 Euro) and honestly that is with us doing quite well compared to many other bands.  THE HUGE IMPACT OF THE WORLD TOUR CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGN The reason that we are doing better than most is in large part due to our amazingly supportive fan base that contributed over $86,000AUD to our World Tour crowd funding campaign in mid-2014. That campaign was so successful that it did exactly what we hoped it would do, it gave us the start up cash to tour all around the world and play for so many of you guys! Since then we have toured through Europe, Asia, India, Middle East, Australia and now finally here we are in North America. It has been the ride of a lifetime and we have decided once and for all that this is what we want to do with our lives.  \n Many bands have to pick and choose where they can afford to tour, but we wanted to try and play for as many of you as possible and YOU guys helped make that happen. The only issue is that simply doing one tour of Europe or North America or Asia doesn't all of a sudden make you a big success in these markets. The bands that are successful come back over and over again - so that’s what we want to do.  But the reality is that our losses mean that our current level of commitment to the band is unsustainable and so we have been trying to work out how to stay on the road so we can keep performing for you guys as often as possible.   \n So while the crowd funding campaign was a huge success and did exactly what we needed it to do, the limitation of a campaign in that setting is that it is designed to fund a particular project (in our case a world tour) and then once the project is done, the money is gone. We’ve often been asked in interviews what we would do after the crowd funding money was gone. Would we crowd fund our next world tour as well? And the response from us was always the same…we’d have to wait and see what felt right when the time came. \n \n REALITY CHECK A few weeks ago we started our USA tour with $36AUD in the bank and about $25,000 in debt due to the massive up front costs of international touring, plus some unpaid bills from our European tour in Oct/Nov. \n If this current tour is a success we can get some of that money back, but we are treading an extremely fine line now between giving ourselves the best opportunity to tour and make new fans, and going broke. \n To make things even more precarious, in the past few months,  all of us  have lost our primary day jobs back home. Dan left his job as a train driver as they refused to give him more time off work to tour, Tim’s job as a violin teacher at a school back in Melbourne didn't work out anymore seeing he was rarely there, and while Matt managed to keep a job he had to downgrade to casual, meaning he’s had to do some insane financial juggling to be able to pay his mortgage so that his wife and two kids were going to be ok while we’re away on this tour. In general everyone in the band is facing significant financial hardship. \n The reality is that there is a gap in the industries ability to provide enough revenue for a band like us, and as a result, we are stuck in a situation where we tour too much to hold down a normal day job, but at the same time aren’t getting paid for playing in the band. \n \n WE WANT TO DO THIS FULL TIME We love playing in this band, and we'll be straight with you, we want to do this full time. It is extremely difficult to hold down any sort of normal job with the amount of touring we are doing at the moment and that leaves us with only two options: 1. Find a way that we can start making a profit and get paid for what we do in NeO, so that we can continue to pursue this as a full-time endeavour and tour the world on a regular basis. OR 2. Cut back on how seriously we are taking the band and instead just do it as a hobby and maybe do one big international tour every 2 years. \n \n WHAT ABOUT DOING IT FOR THE LOVE? Nobody playing in a metal band, let alone a band as unique as ours is doing it for the money, but the reality is that Tim's 3 year old daughter, Matt's wife and two kids, and Dan's mortgage - any of these real life concerns don't get paid by the love and affection of people who enjoy our music.  \n The only reason we do this IS for the love of it and that is why we want to do this full time. In the last 10 months, we have spent 5 of them on the road not getting paid a dime. If you can imagine what it would be like to try and survive the next year if almost half of that time you had no job and no income whatsoever then you can understand that regardless of how amazing it is to tour the world, that you can’t survive long term with so little money. \n Realistically, this is an issue that affects thousands of bands across the world; it’s just that nobody likes to talk about it. However we strongly feel that if given the opportunity, many fans would be willing to help fund the future of the bands that are creating music they love, and so we want to put that belief into practice. \n \n A NEW WAY FORWARD IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY We wouldn’t have been able to take that next step in our career without the massive support we have received from our fans. But with the crowd funding money long gone and enormous touring opportunities on the horizon, for a while now we have been trying to work out what to do next.  \n What we are asking of NeO fans is a small ongoing commitment; to become patrons of Ne Obliviscaris through a new platform called Patreon, where you can contribute as little or as much as you want on a monthly basis: \n \n www.patreon.com/neobliviscaris \n In return, as well as the knowledge that you are directly supporting and financing the music and career of a band you like, we are also going to be creating a host of new content available exclusively to our Patreon members. Some of this content includes exclusive and/or early access to: \n New NeO music, interactive tour video diaries, exclusive merch ranges, pre-sale ticket options, giveaways and competitions, tour podcasts, feature band interviews, Drum, Bass, Violin & Guitar video tutorials from NeO members, live online chats with the band, live video streaming of NeO rehearsals, access to exclusive cover song recordings & more. PLUS VIP levels that include benefits such as free tickets to shows, phone calls from members upon signing up or on your birthday, personal thank you in the liner notes of our next album, side of stage access at shows and even the ability to help choose our set list when we play in your town. \n It is the fans that have the power to decide which bands are successful. Every band that earns a living from their music does so financed by their fanbase, regardless of how many middlemen jump into the mix to dilute the money pool. What we are doing, cuts out all the middlemen and provides a direct way for fans to support NeO in an ongoing fashion. \n If you would like to live in a world where an Australian progressive extreme metal band with a violinist can actually make a living from their music so that they can dedicate themselves 100% to creating the best music and tour the world as often as possible, then this is for you.  \n No band has ever done something quite like this before… so let’s make history together.  - NeO ***************** We want to create an interactive fan experience unlike any other band before us and we need YOUR help to pull this off.  So please, sign up and show your support for us and for this new way forward in the music industry -- and make sure you send through your comments and ideas to help us give you, and all our incredible fans across the world, the best possible value for your contribution. Please note : While some rewards will be delivered every single month, others may only happen when on tour, or in between tours, every couple of months. We have tried to specify where possible, but feel free to contact us with any questions. We have listed an array of different rewards to show you guys the full scope of what we’re planning, and we’ll keep adjusting this over time based on the feedback we get from you all. Thank you!"},

I draw the pictures, and you put your artistic flare into it by bringing it to life with color. You no longer have to be an \"artist\" to take advantage of the benefits art can provide you. I can't tell you how exciting it is to get to share this experience with all of you, because art has literally SAVED me in my life by allowing me to escape to an imaginary, colorful, world of dreams where everything is possible. When I create, whether drawing, painting, or coloring, it feels like I have been swept away to another dimension, and time just floats away. Fans all over the world of all backgrounds, ages, and skill levels are finding great joy, peace, fun, relaxation--and an uplifting community--through what I have always treasured deep in my soul--ART. Art gives. Art connects. Art lives. Art breathes. Art heals. Art is expression. Art is emotion. Art is MAGIC...and it's just what the world needs now :). It's no wonder to me it's become such a popular hobby! I've been providing coloring pages for adults to color for long before the \"coloring craze\" hit--since around 2008, which is over 10 years now. I've sold over 200,000 copies of my coloring books and countless more digital pages in just the last few years. Coloring pages are my jam! Join me in bringing new, fresh Hannah Lynn Whimsy Girl coloring pages every month to the coloring community by collaborating with me and connecting with other fans in this fascinating world where artists and colorists collide!  The pages created for this group are created from start to finish with all of you in mind, by hand. They are only available during the current month, are not available as \"back pages\" for any price, and will never be in a publication or be licensed onto products. They are truly exclusive and just for you as a supporter during the current month! Once you have the PDF file you can print them off as many times as you like and enjoy them for years to come, but by signing up you agree that will not share them with others (sharing colored pages is allowed on social media or as a gift to someone, but sharing uncolored pages with others is against copyright--I retain all copyrights as the artist for these artworks). CHARGE UP FRONT so you don't miss out --This is a \"charge up front\" account. Because the rewards are exclusive to each month with no ability to get back issued rewards, you will be charged (and rewarded) on the day you sign up (even if it's the last day of the month)--and then recurring charges will be scheduled on the first of each month. So, if you sign up on the 28th for example, you will be charged (with that month's rewards sent to you) that day, and then the next charge will occur just a few days later on the first of the following month, and then on the first every month thereafter. This ensures everyone is on the same payment schedule and that each month's rewards are accounted for and delivered properly. I am eternally grateful for the support everyone has given me along the way--I wouldn't be where I am today without all of you! Thank you for making my dreams come true!

I have been making \" weaponized critical memery\"  on Instagram under the handle  @La_Meme_Young  for over four years now, originally as a way a fun way to supplement my own critical writing and sonic arts teaching materials, though now it seems to have become its own monster. I make sound collages and improvised music under the moniker  Peretsky . I write about sounds occasionally over at  Hii Magazine  as well. This virtual class on Patreon will consist of  group critique and performance seminars held over Zoom multiple times a week, video lectures on a variety of topics related to the sonic arts, and conversations with some awesome guest artists. All content will be archived here as audio recordings primarily, though sometimes video as well. The class Discord is equally as important as the content itself, it is an autonomous community of subscribers in 6 continents, which keeps the conversation surrounding sonic arts, sound studies, and experimental music buzzing basically 24/7.  For those interested, the higher tiers of this class relate exclusively to one-on-one sessions for individual subscribers. These sessions can range from a variety of topics based on the interest of the student, including but not limited to: - Improvisation - Composition - Music Production - Audio Engineering - Sound Studies and Music Writing - Music Pedagogy Development"},

If you're here you likely already know at least some of my work and are considering supporting me, and I appreciate it!   Here's the Patreon rundown: Though some people use Patreon as a place to produce and post exclusive content, my page is simply a place to support the works that I already post elsewhere. This includes my YouTube videos, Twitch streams, as well as the occasional piece of original art or music. (And hopefully even more to come.) There's really no extra content that's posted here, it's just a way to support me if you'd like or to get your name at the end of one of my videos. If you're here to donate and support my creative efforts, I really appreciate it! I also feel like I should let you know that I accept donations over on  my Twitch page  as well, where I read messages aloud and get to interact a bit more. There's also a Discord server that you're able to join if you subscribe to me on Twitch for $5. Just wanted to let you know of that option before you committed to Patreon. Anyway thank you very much for even visiting this page in the first place! There's absolutely no obligation for you to donate, just so we're clear. Checking out my work is more than I could ask for, so don't feel like you've got to open your wallet. Thanks again! Ian"},

I'm an artist, cartoonist, illustrator and occasional minor animator who accidentally stumbled into making a small living making YouTube videos, mostly about character design, writing, lore and general creative criticism, usually centered around video games, animation and other nerd nonsense. This Patreon was originally established to support my artwork and comics, but as YouTube and videos took over my life, I've had to transition this Patreon as well. Consequently, I've got a bunch of reward tiers that you can choose from if you'd like to support me, but some of them are a little empty because I don't quite know what I want to offer in them yet. They'll evolve, I hope, as I figure out this YouTube stuff more and more, and I'll add features as my audience suggests them, and as I figure out how to make them worth. For the moment, there's a bit of voting on video topics every once in a while, a monthly Q&A vlog for those who want to watch me answer questions while playing with my adorable rats, and a few options for getting some more personal feedback on artwork/character designs you're creating.

GUYS CAN YOU PLEASE READ THE PINNED POST BEFORE YOU SAY YOU CAN'T FIND MY ANIMATIONS. Thank you. <3 Hey there! It's  Tail-Blazer. Let me start by saying this Patreon is on a Pay Upfront charging basis. When you become a patron, your pledge is immediately taken in instead of being taken on the 1st of each month. After your initial pledge is taken, you'll be charged around every 1st of the month. So it's best to become a patron earlier in the month so you're not charged unnecessarily. Thank You!        I take a traditional approach to Patreon. I treat it like a virtual tip jar with some minor perks. I think of Patreon as more of a tip jar than a \"I gave you money so do these things\" ... jar. However there are some tier rewards for becoming a patron. 5 dollars gets you full access to my explicit content and the ability to vote on monthly art packs and view unreleased animations, as well as early access to said packs. 10 dollars get you the ability to suggest an sketched drawing for me to do. Both tiers gain you early access.        I also don't post daily. People seem surprised by this. However, I do post in clumps, usually a couple times a month. When I finished the requests for the month, I'll post all of it or half of them. Same with the art packs and whatnot. I'm always working, but don't be surprised if you don't see me post until later in the month. I notice some people are suggesting full-on, multiple panel drawings. This isn't what the suggestion box is for. If you'd like that much detail, you can commission it. I'm not doing commission work for close to nothing. The suggestions are always rougher and faster than commission work. For anyone wondering what my work has been in the past to get a feel for what it can be in the future, here is a link :  Tail-Blazer DeviantArt Anyway. I know you guys are anxious for art. So, I'll get back to it. Thank you kindly for reading.

May I call you  Beastling ? You are most likely here because you love music, animals, various forms of art or maybe all of the above. Well, you've come to the right place! How does it work? I've set up 6 tiers that offer a wide range of options so you can choose the one that suits you best! All tiers are cumulative so each tier contains all the benefits of the previous tiers. The  Song of the Season  is available to all tiers; the Merch for Membership is available to Iron, Platinum and Blue Beastlings. More information can be found about it   here . When I launched this Fan Club I could never have imagined the impact it would have. We are a  community  of art lovers and artists supporting and inspiring one another. Knowing there is a receptive audience that appreciates my work  directly  motivates me to grow as a vocalist, try new media, hone my skills and expand my field of work. I love touring the world with Arch Enemy and I hope the state of the planet will soon allow for this again! Making music is my life and, as such, composing and performing music devours my days and years at a blinding speed. It's been almost two decades, now, of losing my mind on metal stages and I am so fortunate to have amassed an amazing, compassionate, unique community of fans over the years. I wanted to make an official place for us to convene, so here we are. Why? I truly want to be singing and screaming original songs on stage for as long as I am breathing! That being said, the music industry is quite different nowadays; musicians have to tour a lot more now than we used to to compensate for the change in market from purchasing albums to streaming them for free. Songwriters are really  not  fairly compensated anymore, so much so that there are all sorts of laws churning up to change that so the world doesn't end up music-less. Albums cost a LOT of money and time for those making them! Luckily, I love touring and - don't get me wrong - I want you to enjoy the music I make however you feel most comfortable; at home and hopefully at live concerts too! We do our very best to perform as far and wide across the Earth as possible.    This, however, means I am  always  on tour and have very little time to devote to writing new material (for both Arch Enemy and ALISSA). Not to mention  The Song of the Season  and all the painting, sculpting,  poetry,   photography  and film projects scratching their way out of my brain! For example, I would really like to be able to create music and music-videos that are extremely personal with my ALISSA solo project; I got to deliver a small taste of that with the  Lizzie music video . How? I've decided to connect directly with you - the amazing fans (the Beastlings) who are already such an important part of my life - right here on Patreon. This is a way that you can DIRECTLY support me as an artist; no labels taking a cut, no agents, no bullshit. Just you and me. You can decide which tier works for you and your presence is tremendously important no matter which tier you choose. This community is a safe space for us where we can feel confident in expressing ourselves, promoting causes we believe in and sharing our thoughts without worry of crazed internet judgement (very, VERY long-time fans might recall that this was the format of my Facebook page for many years). This Fan Club will be more private, sort of like attending one of my club shows where I can high-five you from stage versus a giant outdoor festival with hundreds of thousands of people attending. I also want to have an open line of communication so we can build this community together; it's not only about me, it's about  us .    I've now set up 6 membership packages that I think will be fun for you and give you a lot of options. I will continue to take your feedback into consideration to make this community as mutually rewarding as possible. The beauty is that this whole thing is completely optional - YOU decide if you want to join and how much you would like to pledge and every pledge is greatly appreciated. I can't say it enough -  thank you  for keeping music alive! Now. Real Talk. The awkward part nobody wants to mention.    This part is going to suck so let's just get through it together.  Listen: I know talking about money is a bummer. It actually grosses me out. I have never been good at asking for money for my art. I've done most of my work for free (even now, 18 years in) just because it is  so  hard to even perceive that oneself might actually import a  value . The unfortunate reality is that we are all human, we all have bills to pay, unexpected medical emergencies, families to support, regular boring bullshit nobody wants to acknowledge. But there is no magical \"making it\" ledge you jump off into a world of wealth and luxury when you are an artist. Bills don't suddenly disappear. No dude in a suit shows up, shakes your hand and gives you a briefcase full of money. Fame and followers do not equal dollars and banks don't accept instagram likes as a form of currency. \"Making it\" just means you get the opportunity to work longer and harder... and I am always up for that challenge and burst through any door or window that is ajar.  Advertising  is  a widely accepted way to generate income for tv and radio shows, podcasts, youtube videos, etc. We don't even notice ads because we are so used to them but they rob us of our valuable time. It's not in my nature to advertise things I don't care about. I don't want to become a product. I want to remain myself, remain an artist. I think I will respect myself a lot more earning pledges directly from those who appreciate what I create rather than selling myself out. Exhale.    So,  here it is . The venue is packed. The lights dim. The show is about to start.  Are you front row?  This is it, Beastlings. Welcome to my official Fan Club."},

This is YOUR community!\n \n \n \nIf only 450 of you kicked in $10 a month then we make our goal! Plus we are giving out really cool perks to make it even more worth your while! \n \n \n \n I Wanna Keep Making Dope Shit! \n As a creative person, I've been very successful. I've written  3 books , been  translated  into 4 languages, created and hosted a nationally  televised travel series , been paid to travel the world and  write about it , and penned tons of  viral articles . Those things have almost always been on someone else's imprint though.

Additionally, ALL patrons may accrue credit towards copies of my PDF art book. For every $15 of support you send my way, I will give you a copy.

It’s Jim from Jim'll Paint It. If you’re reading this you probably already know I’m that guy that paints weird pictures for people on Microsoft Paint. What started as a hobby eventually took over all my free time and I ended up quitting my job to keep up with demand. I have never asked for any money for the hundreds of pictures I've painted for people, instead supporting myself by selling prints and T-shirts of the resulting artwork.  But just because someone might appreciate the work I do and enjoy seeing it on their Facebook or Instagram feed, it doesn't necessarily mean they want to wear it on their chest or put it on their wall. The weirder and darker my paintings are, the less money I can hope to make from them and the harder it is to pay my bills. Patreon provides me an opportunity to get a relatively stable source of income and helps keep my content pure and not driven by a need to sell merchandise. Becoming a supporter won't mean preferential treatment in terms of what requests I choose to paint - Jim'll Paint It is free for everyone and always will be - but you will get that warm fuzzy feeling you get when you support something you’ve been enjoying. You'll also get to see the odd early draft, sketch and WIP and stuff that's too explicit for social media in the members section."},

My creative story starts way back in the 1970s before I was born. My parents received a most original wedding present; one guest took their wedding invitation, painted a watercolour scene over the top and sent it back to them as a wedding gift - I grew up with that painting hung on my wall. Through my twenties I enjoyed a varied creative career first as a set and costume designer, then as a stylist and illustrator. I kept searching for the heart and soul in my creative pursuits and the thought of my parent's watercolour wedding stationery inspired me to launch de Winton Paper co.  I started my watercolour wedding stationery business in 2015 and along the way I've also become a watercolour teacher, commissioned artist and  published author ! I am sure that this series of transformations came from sharing my work and process on social media and benefiting from being part of a creative community. I've shared my paintings, stationery commissions and tutorials primarily on  Instagram  - which is where I imagine most of you found me. Whilst 2020 threw my traditional methods of making a living off course, it also provided me with time, inspiration and a renewed appreciation for the creative people I've connected with on social media. Watercolour provides us with a mindful escape as well as a source of creativity and I am so passionate to sustain that feeling of happy calm. There is nothing better than putting brush to paper for a few hours and losing yourself in the watery wonder of watercolour. In Spring of 2020 Ant and I teamed together to start a  Youtube channel : him on all production, me in front of the camera. We're having a great time creating tutorials and meeting a whole new audience. Your curiosity has helped me realise the value in sharing more of my process: all the sketch book pages, experimentation with materials and general creative musings that I've kept to myself are invaluable in their contribution to making me the artist I am today.  I would love to share all of this with you to enhance your watercolour painting experience. I am so grateful to have built a watercolour community on both  Instagram  and  Youtube . I cherish every comment and take a genuine interest in how watercolour and creativity has provided a lifeline for many of you. It's amazing to hear your stories and I feel indebted to you for allowing me to make this my job. A Patreon page will ensure that I can build upon this foundation of online watercolour content and be able to give something back to all of you who have encouraged me and given me so much guidance along the way.  On my Patreon site you'll get bonus content related to my weekly YouTube videos and current painting commissions. Each tier is designed to offer a level of watercolour guidance whether you're new to watercolour or a seasoned painter. If you'd like to support me (thank you!) please choose the monthly pledge that best suits you. You can edit or cancel your pledge at any time.  Thanks for taking the time to find out a little bit more about me - I'm looking forward to doing the same with you!  Harriet xxx"},

Firstly you might want to check out my website library where you can browse all the tutorials I have on offer. Visit my website  HERE Once you become a member you can also use my library to find the content you're looking for. I’ve been helping other artists through my blog and Youtube channel for years, and because there is so much interest in pastel tuition, I thought I’d try to devote more time and energy to video tutorials. This is where you guys come in… By using Patreon as a forum to share this knowledge, you can contribute with a subscription to help me fund this project.  With your support you’ll gain access to  video tutorials, royalty free reference photos, instructional videos, Paint Along demos and more.  All while in the knowledge that you're helping me upgrade my equipment and improve my content. My own background in art starts at an early age with the discovery of pastel and a love for painting animals. I graduated as an Illustrator in 2007 but since then I have produced hundreds of portraits, both pets and people. I also love to paint landscapes, cityscapes, seascapes, interior scenes, whatever inspires me. It’s all about the light for me. There is no better medium to capture it all than pastel. I’ll show you from the basics, right through to capturing the finest detail. I'll also provide practical advice on how to make it as an artist if you want to turn your hobby into your career. I have different levels of subscription to suit all budgets.  Patreon is simple…you can subscribe for as long as you want and it’s really easy to cancel or pause at any time. Make sure you check out my intro video above and I hope I'll see you here on my channel."},

Existen podcasts/videos que aparecen en Dixo, Spotify, Apple y YouTube; artículos periodísticos, en El Financiero; participaciones televisivas en Dinero y Poder; y ocasionalmente entrevistas. Ninguno de esos espacios se presta a un análisis detallado, ni económico ni político/social, que es lo que aquí puedo ofrecer. Para hacer este esfuerzo sustentable en el largo plazo, se requieren dos cosas: que yo pueda compensar el costo de oportunidad y que ustedes reciban valor agregado. Esto último no puedo evaluarlo adecuadamente sin su colaboración. Hoy en día abunda información. En materia económica, desde las agencias internacionales y nacionales hasta los bancos y grupos financieros, pasando por  think tanks  que afortunadamente han florecido en México, de gran calidad. Mi aportación es el análisis que puede ayudar a entender mejor la información, colocándola en contexto, que además intento vaya acompañado de elementos de educación económica y financiera. Es importante que esta aportación corresponda con la que ustedes hacen, y sólo ustedes pueden saberlo. Por esa razón, les solicito que sean tan amables de señalar los puntos que puedan mejorarse, criticar las fallas, proponer ideas. Si esta página no aporta valor, tendrá que desaparecer, algo que no deseo que ocurra al menos durante la próxima década.  Es también muy importante recordarle que el monto está en  dólares , y se cobra mensualmente, para evitar confusiones costosas. Asimismo, en el  momento de la suscripción se realiza el primer cargo ; los siguientes, el primer día de cada mes.

Evrim Ağacı Nedir? \n Evrim Ağacı , Türkiye'nin en uzun soluklu, en eski, en köklü, en büyük, en güvenilen ve en çok ziyaret edilen bilim oluşumlarından birisidir. 5 Kasım 2010'da kurulmuş olan Evrim Ağacı, kurulduğundan bu yana  tamamen ücretsiz bir şekilde  bilim yazıları, makaleler, videolar, görseller ve çeşitli diğer içerikler hazırlamakta veya diğer dillerden Türkçeye güvenilir içerikleri kazandırmaktadır.  Facebook Sayfası ,  Facebook Grubu ,  YouTube ,  Twitter  ve  Instagram  gibi sosyal medya platformları aracılığıyla başta Türkiye, Azerbaycan, Almanya, Avusturya, ABD ve Kanada gibi ülkelerde olmak üzere her ay milyonlarca okura erişen Evrim Ağacı'nın en büyük hedefi, Türkiye'den çıkan amatör bir bilim oluşumunun tüm dünyada ses getirecek işlere imza atması ve Türkiye'yi uluslararası bilimsel platformda başarıyla temsil edebilmektir. Evrim Ağacı'nın vizyonunda, aşağıda bazıları belirtilmiş olan basamaklardan geçerek, başta Türkiye olmak üzere dünyada bilimsel farkındalığı ve modern bilimin halka etkin bir şekilde ulaştırılabilmesini sağlamaktır. \n \n \n \n\t \n \n Hayallerimiz ve Hedeflerimiz \nEvrim Ağacı olarak birçok sayıda planımız var. Bunların kimi küçük ve kısa vadeli, kimiyse büyük ve uzun vadeli çalışmalar. Özellikle gerçekleştirmeyi hayal ettiğimiz büyük projelerimiz için uzun seneler ve giderek artan ciddiyette ve yoğunlukta çalışmalar gerektirecek; ancak burada listelememizin sebebi, Evrim Ağacı okurları olarak sizlerin sadece misyonumuzu değil; aynı zamanda vizyonumuzu da görebilmenizdir.  Ne kadarını başarabiliriz, bunu ancak zaman gösterecek. Bildiğimiz tek bir şey var:  Gece-gündüz demeden çalışıp, Türkiye’deki bilimsel düzeyi arttırmak ve aydınlanmayı sağlamak için elimizden geleni yapacak ve dijital içeriklerimiz (makaleler, görseller, videolar, vb.)  her zaman ücretsiz olarak  halkımız tarafından erişilebilir olacak . Ancak aklımızda gerçekleştirmek istediğimiz projeler için sizin yardımlarınız olmadan çoğunu başarmamız mümkün değil. İşte hayallerimizin bir kısmı: Evrim Ağacı'nı tam-zamanlı meslek haline getirmek. İçerik üreticilerimize emeklerinin karşılığını maddi olarak da ödeyebilmek. Evrim Ağacı Dergisi  için ekip kurup, dergiyi düzenli olarak çıkarabilmek. Halka açık ve ücretsiz olan  Türkiye Evrimle Tanışıyor  etkinliklerimizi tüm illerimize yaymak. Türkiye'de çeşitli kafelere  Bilim Cafesi  statütüsü kazandırarak bilim kültürünü halk arasına yaymak. Yeni dijital projelere (bilimsel sosyal medya ağı, kitap platformu, bilim buluşma platformu, bilim dükkanı, vb.) imza atmak. Yayımladığımız  popüler bilim   kitaplarının  sayısını ve sıklığını arttırmak. Her yaştan insanın katılacağı, bilimsel eğitim verilen yaz kampları başlatmak. Evrim Ağacı Stüdyoları 'nı hayata geçirip video projelerimizi profesyonelleştirmek. Türkiye'de belgeselcilik ve doğa fotoğrafçılığı kültürünü yerleştirmeye yönelik çalışmalar başlatmak. Gelecek Bilimde  isimli  canlı yayınlarımızı  profesyonelleştirmek ve TV yayınlarına dönüştürmek. Türkiye'de halkımıza açık bir  Evrim Ağacı Bilim Merkezi  kurmak ve tüm üniversitelerimizde öğrenci topluluğu şubeleri açmak. Evrim Ağacı Yayınevi  adı altında bir basımevi ve yayınevi başlatabilmek ve kendi seçeceğimiz bilim kitaplarını dilimize kazandırmak, Türk bilim yazarlarını teşvik etmek. İngilizce içerikler üretmeye başlayarak Evrim Ağacı'nı uluslararası bir statüye kavuşturmak. Bir  eğitim vakfı  kurmak. ABD'de bir  Evrimsel Bilimler Araştırma Merkezi  açarak, Türkiye'den gelecek öğrencilere staj, yüksek lisans, doktora ve doktora sonrası programları sunabilmek. Bu hayallerin çoğunu gerçekleştirebilmek için epey çaba gerekli ve maalesef maddi destekler olmaksızın uygulanmaları fazlasıyla zor ya da imkansız. Ancak  biz, Türkiye'nin tüm bunlara ve çok daha fazlasına layık olduğuna inanıyoruz! Bu yazının en tepesinde bazı ödeme yöntemleri paylaştık, ancak bizleri aslen ayakta tutmayı sağlayacak ve uzun yıllar sürdürülebilir kılacak olan seçenek  Patreon .  Eğer  Patreon   üzerinden en az 2000 düzenli destekçiye erişebilirsek, Evrim Ağacı'nı ömrümüz boyunca tam-zamanlı mesleğimiz olarak sürdürebilir ve hiçbir ek desteğe, sponsora, vb. ihtiyaç duymaksızın büyüyebilir ve Türkiye'deki aydınlanma mücadelesinin vazgeçilmez bir parçası haline gelebiliriz.  Eğer maddi destek konusunda merak ettiğiniz noktalar varsa ve  Patreon  hakkında daha fazla bilgi almak istiyorsanız  buraya tıklayabilirsiniz .

Damit das nicht passiert, findet auf seinem Blog eine Auseinandersetzung mit besagten Antagonisten statt. Mit Leuten, die die Klimakrise nicht begriffen haben, die von veganen Produkten abraten, weil sie angeblich aus “Chemie” bestehen. Die denken, wir könnten unsere Städte vor dem Verkehrskollaps bewahren, indem wir mehr Straßen bauen und darauf weiterhin Benzinautos herumfahren lassen. Der Autor selbst lebt in Wiesbaden, hat ursprünglich mal wenig erfolgreich Mathe studiert und das dann (je nach Betrachtungswinkel) erfolgreich mit BWL versucht. Er hat keine journalistische Ausbildung, aber immerhin eine Art Online-Fernstudium bei Stefan Niggemeier absolviert, indem er dessen komplettes Werk im Bildblog verschlungen und sich den dort vorgelebten Anspruch an Transparenz zu eigen gemacht hat. Auf dem Blog wird bewusst keine Werbung geschaltet, weil dadurch eine objektive Berichterstattung eingeschränkt werden könnte und der Autor sich niemandem verpflichtet fühlen möchte - außer seiner Leserschaft natürlich. Er bestreitet seinen Lebensunterhalt aktuell mit den Spenden seiner LeserInnen und etwas Erspartem - in der Hoffnung, dass die Spendenhöhe schneller die Höhe seiner monatlichen Ausgaben deckt als das Sparkonto alle ist  Eigentlich ist er ein recht anspruchsloser Mensch und gibt 95% seines Budgets für Wohnen und Essen aus - auch weil er drei Genexperimente in die Welt gesetzt hat, die gemessen an ihrer Größe erstaunlich großen Hunger entwickeln können.  Aktuell kann er mit Spenden und Auftragsarbeiten ca. 70% seiner Ausgaben decken.Lange Rede, kurzer Sinn: Will write articles\nfor food!

The Shadowscapes Tarot was one of the early projects I took on, and the first where I decided to follow my own desires and art instincts. I also am the author of the Dreamscapes series of watercolor technique books.\n \n \nOver the years, I've loved sharing how I do what I do with you, my audience. I mean this with regards to creative inspiration, running an art business, and in technical tricks and materials. I love knowing that my own passion can inspire other people to find and succeed in their own passions as well. It is rewarding to hear from people across the entire spectrum, from non-artists who just want insight into creative processes, to students and teachers coming across Dreamscapes in their libraries, to aspiring young artists who in turn have now become professionals as well.\n \n \n \n \n\"More Videos!\"\n \n \nThe internet and technology is always evolving, and so in recent years one of the requests I've heard the most often is for \"More Videos!\" This has always been tricky for me as it is disruptive to my workflow, and can be awkward to paint with a camera in front of me. Video editing is also very time consuming. I \n want  to be able to create videos for you, because I'd love to be able to share a more real-time and in-depth view of some of my processes.  \n \n \n \nBeing open and sharing my knowledge with the world has always been important, and I want to keep as much of that free and accessible as possible; but I hope with your help here on Patreon to be able to create much more instructional content than I would otherwise be able to do. With patron funds, and with your interaction and input, I'd love to explore and play with techniques and have you help decide what direction to go with these tutorials -- showing content that you tell me you'd like to see so that we can move forward collaboratively! After a one month delay I will release most of the instructional videos to the public as well, because as I said, it is very important to me to continue being able to reach young artists, students, and people who have little access to these resources, but your support here will be key to having this material happen in the first place. \n \n \n \n \n What else? \n \nAnother benefit of being a patron will be access to some of the raw sketches and stages of my painting. Let's face it, social media is a very curated experience. As artists, we have to be mindful of the fact that everything we show on a \n Facebook  page or  Instagram  is viewed not only by artists, but by potential clients, galleries, and publishers. As such, we can't ever show \"the ugly phase\" of a painting or those less than photogenic steps that nevertheless might reveal a lot about the thought process and decisions that go into the creation. I'll take you behind the scenes and give you first glimpses of new material that hasn't been released to the public, secret projects in the works, as well as first opportunity when it comes to access to my original paintings. \n \n \nThanks for stopping by!\n \n \n- Stephanie\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t \n \n The Rewards: \n \n \n $1 / Through the Looking Glass \n \n Thank you for being part of this endeavor!

When you support WDWNT by pledging a monthly contribution, we bring you exclusive content across all of our platforms, including post-shows for ParksCenter and WDWNT News Tonight, exclusive video programming like D-Tailed and Ride Rehab Watches, bonus content like pdfs of historical Disney documents, and of course our WIGS-exclusive Discord channel (WIGScord) where you can interact with your fellow WIGS and WDWNT staff.

And I want to share all my knowledge with you my dear friends! This meditative drawing taught me one important philosophy. When you draw symmetry by pens you can not be absolutely accurate, like a machine, and somewhere inaccurate lines or uneven patterns can come out, you can’t fix it and you can only learn from it. But when you look already at the completed whole beautiful artwork you recognize that there were no mistakes along this path. The whole picture looks amazing.

Une newsletter hebdomadaire qui couvre toutes les news croustillantes du monde de l'horreur sur grand et petit écran (et parfois dans la littérature et les jeux vidéo aussi), avec des micro-critiques de ce que j'ai vu dans la semaine, ainsi qu'un calendrier des sorties ciné et VOD.  Des articles pop culture. Comme vous le savez, j'ai quelques obsessions pop-culturelles bien marquées, comme par exemple le cinéma d'horreur et les teen movies, mais également les séries (j'en regarde beaucoup trop). Je suis souvent très frustrée de ne pas pouvoir m'étaler sur le sujet, et j'ai rarement la motivation de le faire \"pour rien\", donc si ça vous intéresse, vous pourrez être mon média personnel et nous pourrons discuter ensemble à travers mes articles et vos réactions de toutes ces obsessions qui sont encore meilleures quand elles sont partagées.  Je réfléchis encore à d'autres formats et surtout : je suis ouverte aux propositions. Que ce soit pour le média utilisé ou le sujet abordé, s'il y a quelque chose qui vous fait envie, n'hésitez surtout pas à m'en faire part — ce sera l'occasion de tester des nouveaux trucs entre nous, bien cachés, en toute intimité, et comme ça vous me direz vous-même ce qui marche mieux ou moins bien. Vidéos, notes audio, fiction, atelier d'écriture improvisé, lives organisés, tout est possible et je suis prête à tester plein de trucs avec vous. En plus de tout ça, vous serez les premier-es au courant de mon actualité (sorties littéraires, nouveaux projets, etc.). Concernant les projets extérieurs (livres, podcasts, etc) je verrai avec les personnes en charge ce que je peux vous offrir sans briser mon contrat avec eux parce que bon, s'agirait pas de foutre la merde non plus, mais j'essayerai dans la mesure du possible de vous mettre dans la boucle pour que vous soyez en tête de liste. Par exemple, vous pourrez être les premier-es à découvrir la couverture de mon prochain livre, ça se tente...  Concernant la régularité, vu que c'est tout neuf, je ne veux pas vous faire de promesse de type \"tous les jeudis à 18h NOUVEL ARTICLE GARANTI\" mais je peux vous assurer qu'il y aura au MINIMUM un nouveau contenu par mois. Sinon c'est pas trop du jeu. Plus vous serez nombreux et plus on échangera ensemble, plus j'aurai d'idées pour augmenter la cadence, mais pour l'instant je cherche mon public de bêta-testeur-ses."},

Because of this change, I'm dedicating all my time and resources available, but doing this doesn't generate a lot of money to keep the lights on, pay for miscellaneous things that you need daily. In fact, keeping I Need Diverse Games afloat would cost me what little I had to spare when I was employed.  To survive, pay my rent and keep fed, along with the cat, etc I need to ideally pull in $3000 a month, but to truly have all bills paid, be able to attend conventions, etc I need to hit a goal of about $4K a month.  I outlined this in a recent post on my blog , and I've copied some of that below. Ideally I would need at least $2500 - $3500 a month coming in to cover the following: Rent $1,035 a month (unchanged for Oct 1, 2020) Bills, including internet, electricity, cooking gas, etc. ($1,100) Pet costs ($150) Groceries ($450) Insurance ($800 a month under ACA, as long as we have it) Transit costs ($100 a month, unlimited rides on CTA) If you can help me support myself while I do this work it would be great. Thank you in advance for any help you can give so I can continue to do this full time. Please note, that there is a separate Patreon for I Need Diverse Games, found at patreon.com/INeedDivGms "},

My name is Nathan (Nerrel on the streets) and I create gaming videos and texture art.  Creating videos is extremely time consuming as it requires a lot of playing to reach and capture specific points of interest before the editing and narrating can even begin.  Drawing textures is also laborious and even when working full time on these projects it can still take weeks to produce enough for a video upload.  What will my pelts be used for, and what of the hunts in the Upper Country? The main reason to donate is to afford me the ability to work on these projects full-time, and even the smallest donations help.  I also use these donations to expand the scope of what I'm able to do- I've used the funds collected so far to purchase a capture card, software, texture library subscriptions, games to review, and materials for bits I wouldn't have done otherwise, like a twerking claymation Tingle.  That happened. The Bay of Fundy is rich and wild, and the boldest of coureur des bois have grown fat from its bounty Don't you also receive revenue from YouTube?  Will your shocking greed never be satiated? My essays very frequently use excerpts from other channels or copyrighted music that disqualifies them from monetization.  I could omit these materials but I think that would reduce the quality of the videos and the effectiveness of the comparisons I make.  As it is, I only monetize the handful of video essays that are primarily based on my own captures (texture progress videos are never monetized).   YouTube also doesn't provide as much as most people probably believe...  This is the amount earned by my Resident Evil 3 review in its first month: I wanted stars and did not get stars How often will new content be posted? I only share content that has been given its full time in the oven and don't want to rush anything to meet arbitrary deadlines, but the general goal is for a new video every two weeks.  There may be periods where one project gets more attention than the other, but work is  always  getting done.  A few weeks without a commentary video means that I've been focused on drawing textures, or vice versa. I'll continue making content even without any support, but your donations will help improve the pace and the quality. What will I get in return? In addition to helping me work on material, donating any amount will get you my thanks and the ability to participate in polls, suggest the subject of future videos, and a special Discord role to let everyone know you mean business.  Anyone brave enough to donate $5 or more will have their name included at the end of every video,* documenting their importance and heroism for all time. *Terms and restrictions apply.  Do not choose a name that is offensive, or so dumb that it's stupid.

I’m an artist currently based in Somerset, UK. After finishing my fine art degree I felt lost and eventually began teaching.

This completely changed my perspective and gave me the opportunity to concentrate on making art and working fearlessly in my art journals. My process took me on a magnificent and transformational journey where I experienced creativity as a healing medicine. I now love to share my heart-felt journaling process and painting techniques here in this special community of creative souls. I do what I love because I truly believe, creativity heals the soul. Having your company and support truly means the world to me, and, whichever tier you join, for whatever amount of time, I appreciate every single one of you. Xx Thank you so much!

You are some of the most hardcore Pokemon Go players in the world and I know you appreciate the extreme efforts we put into making this website for you to use. Pokebattler.com has been a work of love, with hundreds of hours of development work to build the best Pokemon Go gym and raid combat simulator in the world.   A little about us: Founder and CEO Ryan Barker Ryan Barker has been playing video games and writing software since he was 10 years old.  He started on a TI-99/4A and have moved on to building major websites professionally. He started this site as a hobby to learn some new technologies and to have a bit of fun but it has turned into so much more than that for him and my many fans around the world. Ryan loves building this site. He loves knowing he has helped hundreds of thousands of people optimize their Pokemon Go playing with this site he built mostly by himself.  CMO   Shelley Barker  Shelley Barker is married to Ryan Barker. She initially had no idea what he was talking about when he mentioned starting this website. But eventually, she figured it out and has been helping any way she can. With zero programming skills and a background in advertising, she has helped build and manage the research articles section of Pokebattler, create and update countless infographics, create and narrate YouTube videos and manage branding and other social channels. She also recently revamped the help menu so that is (hopefully) makes more sense.  Supporting Pokebattler.com  So why should you support us? We have some big plans for what we want to do with this site. The costs are creeping up each month as we start to generate more and more traffic.  The projected costs for the features we want to add is even higher so the more support we have, the more we can give you. We'd also love to eventually support some of the article writers and others who have helped out along the way.  Ads have been removed from the site and Patreon is our only source of revenue at this time. Your donations are all that keep the site running. What can you get for your support? So far: more Pokemon in your Pokebox. Higher quality simulations for your custom Pokebox rankings. Access to the beta site. Special advice spreadsheets.  Much higher settings for the easy to use custom matrix simulations.  A warm fuzzy feeling knowing you supported a husband and wife duo who built this site just for people like you. And we plan to continue coming up with more premium features in the future. Have a different idea of what you want to see us offer? Send us a message at  [email protected]   Now What? You have 2 options Decide it's worth it to donate to keep Pokebattler ad free. Simply sign up for Patreon using the same email address you signed up for Pokebattler with, and pick your subscription level. You will then be able to log in using Patreon and receive your benefits. Decide it's not worth it. In this case, still create a Patreon account with the same email address as you signed up for Pokebattler. Then log out of Pokebattler and log in with the Patreon log in option.  You will receive your extra Pokebox space.  After you have logged in one time with Patreon, you may then resume logging in your old way. Thanks for reading and enjoy Pokebattler!"},

Looking at how Muslim apologists tell you only half of the truth, seeing Islam being spread by proselytizers in the West, I decided to go out there and spread awareness while presenting facts and my views. I have no interest in slandering people or ideas dishonestly nor in praising them wrongfully. I want to show people what media and believers don't want to show --- whether they hide it out of cowardice, political correctness, or for other reasons. Join me on this journey and let's spread awareness. Let us make people know what Islam really is and how it defines its followers.  Let's look at  facts  only because facts are enough to show and understand the truth. I have no interest in defamation and separation whatsoever. This is no \"hate campaign\" and, in all honesty, I think that the notion that all followers of a belief system are horrible people is just as simpleminded as the notion that all believers of that belief system are great. Free speech and the criticism of ideas don't harm anyone, dangerous ideas do. I am merely interested in information and I want to present correct information that can help curious believers, Ex-Muslims, those who are interested in Islam, those who already know about Islam, and myself.  Knowledge is something that everyone should be able to reach and to possess. Forbidding it is oppression. Oh, while doing all of this, we will have a lot of fun, because satire is miraculous.

Des Focus qui analysent la philosophie, la stratégie et l'histoire de grands éditeurs aux Critiques de jeux qui cherchent à comprendre ce qu'ont voulu concevoir les développeurs, dans quelles conditions, et évalue le fruit de leurs efforts. Un certain nombre d'articles sont en accès libre et vous pouvez les consulter  à cette adresse . Une partie de la Base de donnée est également en accès libre. Qui je suis ?

J'ai également travaillé sur deux livres édités par  Pix'n Love  :  La Guerre des Mascottes , coécrit avec William Audureau, qui fait suite à L'Histoire de Mario et s'intéresse à la profusion de jeux de plateforme au début des années 90, et  L'Histoire de Zelda  qui raconte les coulisses des développements des Zelda, du premier à Majora's Mask.

I rap. I draw. I score films. You may know me from Living Legends, G&E, 3MG and Grand Tapestry. \n \n  Why I Love to Create Art  \n \nI was 17 when I recorded \"\n As They Pass \" in Grouch's basement. At that point, it didn't matter whether I was flat broke, malnourished with no official place to live. Why?  Because I was in heaven. I was making music! I was in love. \n \nI knew what I wanted to do from a young age. I knew in the 6th grade. I wanted to make music and art. I wanted to write and draw. I wanted nothing else. 21 years after \"\n As They Pass ,\" I'm still as in love as I was at 12. Although now, the desire to heal people has become a part of my art mission. I want to change the way you feel. I want to let you know you're not alone. I want to help you get clean, and I want to help you past the shackles of anxiety. And just as it was in 1996, I do  EVERYTHING  myself.  The Challenge of Being Independent  \nI used to pay my bills with CD sales. It was my most reliable income for many years. But once the digital revolution took its course, you could imagine, artists like me, lost a reliable revenue stream. I hope streaming services will one day pay us royalties we deserve, but I can't afford to wait for that day. I've never had a label, or even a team of people working for me. I've had a couple of amazing people walk with me through the years, but have never been able to KEEP people on because money has never been steady enough. (Shout out to my brother Eamon)\n \n \nBUT, somehow I've survived, and thrived, and am making some of my favorite music and art to date. How is that possible?? YOU ! My family. My people. I've used the digital world to get closer to you. To reach out directly to people who care about what I create. And every time I reach out, you guys respond. \n And although these bursts of support help me tremendously, this is a way to create some stability for me through your monthly support. \n \nWith the support you guys give me here, I can spend time creating, without worrying about how I'm going to make it through the month financially. I can get videos made, order new merch, give my albums a chance to be heard with proper promotional push. It also gives me another opportunity to offer supporters something unique and personal from me.\n \n \n  How Your Support Benefits You as Patrons (Rewards)  \nAs a $5 a month supporter, you will get a new song each month. \n At the end of the year, every year, you'll have a 12 song album that no one else will.  Only my Crow Family support team. It might be an instrumental, it might be a song, might be a film score, I won't know till I make it! I created a Crow Fam podcast, where I've been telling stories, and breaking down the history behind all of my solo album releases, as well as answering questions from the family on the pod!  \n \nI will also be holding a live video chat for supporters only, once a month, where we can talk about anything we want, AND I will draw an 11x14 piece once a month, scan it, and send everyone a high res image that you can print out and frame if you wanted. \n Only my Patrons will get it.   \n \nNow of course, if any of you felt you could help me out with more than $5 a month, please feel free. That would be amazing! \n \nFor those who could afford $25 or up a month, you will get everything mentioned above, plus a spot on my guest list for any show, anytime, for as long as your a supporter. For those who can pledge $50 and up, you get all of the above, plus a phone call once a month with me, to talk about life for a bit, or whatever you feel!\n \n \nI've said this before, and I mean it, YOU are my lifeline! YOU guys allow me to continue chasing my dreams. \n This support will bring me stability, something I've never had as an indie-underground artist, and hopefully it will bring you joy in return. \n \nHope to see you join Crow Fam... Love you guys ! \n \n \nEligh\n \n \n  FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)  When will I get charged?  New patrons get charged as soon as you sign up and will get charged the first of the month moving forward. So if you sign up on the 15th, you'll get charged that day and you will get charged the 1st of every month as long as you are subscribed. This also means if you sign up at the end of the month like the 31th, you will get charged back to back. If that happens, just let me know and I will refund you a month. How do I get access to older art pieces and songs from previous months?  Only 3 month's worth of art pieces and songs will be available for $5 and $10 tiers at any given time. If you want to get access to the entire archive, you will need to be in a $15 and up tier. You only need to do this for one month, then you can easily move down to a $5 or $10 tier to continue getting new art and songs each month. You can also message me and I can share links to the archived content. When will the new song and print drop?  The 4th of the month. How can I listen to Patreon exclusive songs and podcasts outside of the Patreon app? There's a cool feature called an RSS Feed that posts all of my Patreon songs and podcast episodes to your podcast listening app. This makes it more convenient to listen to any Patreon audio files on your smartphone. When I put out a new song or episode on Patreon, it will automatically load into your favorite podcast listening app. This RSS Feed will only allow you to access the audio files for the tier that you're in as it's unique to your account. Check out this link on how to set it up for your phone: https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041347732#h_9f9ac9db-45f0-4a0d-9c37-9010442b2887   Why am I required to input a shipping address ?  To make it easier for us to ship you any physical rewards or merch items, we collect this information ahead of time. If you were not required to enter your shipping address when you first signed up, go to \"My profile settings\" in the drop-down list by clicking the upper right-hand corner. There should be a section where you input your address for physical items. Can I cancel at any time?  Yes, you can cancel for any reason at any time. You can also adjust your pledge amount to a lower tier if you don't want to completely drop out. When do you host video chats?  Usually mid-month. I will make a post around a week before a tentative date as a heads up. \n How does the guestlist for shows work?  As long as you're an Owl member, you can get on the guestlist of any show I'm performing at. There might be an occasional show this won't work for, such as big festivals where I don't have a huge guest list, either way, I'd let you know! Just send an email to  [email protected]  when the show you want to attend is coming up. When do  monthly phone calls take place?  For my Phoenix members, monthly phone call reminders are sent out the first week of the month. You can select and schedule your 30-minute time slot on a first come first serve basis from the available days each month. When are Crowcasts released each month?  New podcasts will drop around the middle of each new month."},

I'm an artist living and working in South-East London, painting landscapes and documenting life and travels in my sketchbook.  Over the years, I've been incredibly lucky to be part of this community of creatives; all of us similarly just trying to embrace the pursuits that light us up and do whatever we can with them. I never could have imagined that in sharing my own journey through the ever-present self-doubt and the unshakable and constant desire to learn and improve, I'd be able to build a career where I can spend my days making art and sharing every lesson learned, every step of the way.                 WHY PATREON?              I would love for anyone who dreams of pursuing art in any capacity to feel confident that they can do it and I hope I can make that pursuit even the slightest bit easier with my own experiences and advice. That's what I'm here for.                 WHAT NEXT?                I'm excited to get personal with you, to answer your questions and lift the lid on what I'm getting up to behind-the-scenes. I'm also so looking forward to getting the chance to make much more art and fulfill my passion for packaging with the physical reward bundles!! I might be looking forward to that the most  😂 😂 🌸🌸🌸🌸        How does it all work?        Pledge any amount you like and get instant access to the rewards that go along with them. Payments are processed when you pledge and then at the beginning of the month after that (so if we're close to the end of the month, consider waiting to sign up until the start of the new month to save yourself some money!) Once you've pledged, you get instant access to all existing content and I’ll be posting new content regularly throughout the month! The best part is you can cancel or change your pledge whenever you want! Whatever you choose, even if nothing at all, thanks for showing an interest in my art and thanks for even just checking this out you lovely person!"},

You may recognize me from such youtube videos as \" HEY PUSSY,  THE JON JONES STORY \", \" HEAD MOVEMENT, THE EDMOND TARVERDYAN STORY \". You may even recognize me from that 360p, 20 second clip of Day of Defeat Source that i uploaded to Youtube in 2006. I'm making long form videos about MMA and having a blast doing it. And I'm stunned, shocked but mostly super happy that people enjoy watching me spend hours trawling the internet for the best Simpsons memes to make fun of Jon Jones crippling dick pill addiction. If you're one of my subscribers, you're a real one, and I wouldn't be making videos without OG's like you. I've said it before, but i legitimately mean it, every one of you keeps me more motivated than a highly motivated BJ Penn. Like most people, (Breatharians aside) i need food and money to survive. These videos take me months to make, as its all a one man show. Writing, editing, and researching is all done by me. I don't make a cent from YouTube as the videos are generally considered \"not advertiser friendly\" on generally un-monetizable. I also refuse to do sponsorships. So fuck you,  Raid Shadow Legends . I like to keep the spirit of punk rock alive like that. Any money you donate via Patreon is helping me do stupid stuff like paying for artists to make 8bit cover versions of Steven Seagal's dancehall classic  Strut. Just Bleed,  Napoleon."},

We create adult games and artwork, with strong dystopian themes, as well as more light-hearted content like webcomics! Our work frequently covers dark, and often debauched settings, ranging from high fantasy worlds ravaged by the tragedies of war and plague, to post-apocalyptic cities plagued by infected horrors, famine, and corrupt authorities. If these sound like things you'd be into, then without any further ado, please check out some of the content that we've been working on, shown below! --- [ ADULT GAMES ] When we first started the Dystopian Project, there was a scarcity of \"real\" adult games out there. Most adult games were little more than slideshows, with little in the way of gameplay or writing. Sometimes, even the art wasn't original. We aimed to change that! Since our inception, we've gone on to have a track record for completing adult games, with the fully-finished title, Overgrown: Genesis, under our belt and published on Steam as of May 2020, thanks largely to the continued support of our patrons!  Regarding adult game development, our goal is always to combine compelling stories with gorgeous artwork, backed by gameplay elements designed to complement the dark and kinky content, rather than detract from it, as so many games make the mistake of doing! As such, we often make use of a variety of unorthodox settings and characters! For instance, in one of our games, you can play as a refugee in a dark fantasy world, but atypically for such a setting, you play a peasant girl with zero combat ability, far from the \"hero that saves the world\". As a result, you must rely solely on quick wit, observation skills, stealth, and other non-combat traits in order to survive in a harsh new world plagued by all manner of evils. In another game, you play as the spunky survivor of a zombie apocalypse, potentially armed to the teeth, and ready to take on anything with sheer grit alone. However, you will soon find it much easier to conserve your supplies and weaponry, and to sneak past a threat rather than going in guns blazing.  You'll also find people in power that will send you on dangerous fetch quests in exchange for their aid... But who would be just as willing to help you if you meekly got on your knees, stuck out your tongue, and submitted to them as their plaything. In our games, we like to feature well-rounded female heroines who, when confronted with difficult situations, can either kick ass, stealthily sneak past the obstacle, or outright succumb to the depravity that surrounds them...  ... And, depending on how you, the player, have built up their personality over the course of their journey, you might find they even  enjoy  the indignity of it all.  Their choices are many, and their ultimate fate is in the hands of you, the player. Will you have the heroine make a noble last stand, or take the easy way out, and give in to oppression? We pride ourselves in going the extra mile to really make the adult games we work on stand out as actual  games,  rather than glorified hentai galleries.  To do that, we make use of unique assets in areas like our overworlds and item inventories that are all drawn from scratch, and use customized user interfaces specifically tailored to suit our unorthodox gameplay styles. We also put painstaking effort into characters portraits, setting design, and even on original music and sound effects! If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, consider pledging to us and   becoming a patron  to support our development efforts! But first, feel free to join our  Public Discord  to get access to the latest FREE public versions of our games, and get a taste of what we're offering!  --- \n \n [ WEB COMIC ] We are currently publishing a monthly-ish webcomic featuring the characters from our games in adorable chibi form, as showcased below! This is a mini-series featuring their non-canon shenanigans, after we ask the wall-breaking question,  \"What if the characters from the games were fully aware that they're all characters in a game? ... And also, met up regularly at a bar or something to unwind?\" The webcomic is totally SFW, and only ever gets to an \"ecchi\" level in terms of adult content. This series is free and publicly viewable, although our patrons do get to read the latest comic strips in advance! --- [ ARTWORK ] Every month, our art team works on a lot of miscellaneous artwork, from character concepts to setting designs, that we often eventually work into our games! These art pieces are often planned out and completed before the certain levels of a game end up \"built\" around them. We really do work on a wide variety of things, such as planning out how certain types of monsters look, act, and feel...  ... to designing rather fun character concepts, like, say, a towering Viking wonderwoman who forcibly conscripts your ass to go on a kinky Odyssey-type adventure.  And of course, we also work on polished, high-quality CG sets that take place in a wide range of settings and situations, with scenes such as a young traveler stepping out onto dry land after a long voyage, and gazing out at an idyllic sunrise...  ... and then there's decidedly more mischievous scenes that should leave  very  little up to the imagination...! --- [ WHY BECOME A PATRON? ] Well, I'd like to think that if you enjoyed our work, you wouldn't mind contributing to our production costs!  You see, I'm a writer. That's all I am. I'm a poor artist, and a horrendous coder. But, writing alone isn't enough to create awesome adult games and comics. As such, I need to hire skilled artists, programmers, and other creative talents to \ndevote their time to work on the Dystopian Project. That is where you come in!  By becoming a patron, you allow me to pay for their services, and keep on working on games, comics, and artwork! If you are new to Patreon, please note that pledges are NOT a one-time donation. When you make a pledge and become a patron, you're basically committing to pay an amount of your \nchoosing every month. As a patron, you will get to see NSFW sneak peeks and concept artwork on our post feed, as well as gain exclusive access to ALL the games we produce! Every month, you'll also be able to vote on the direction of our production process and directly influence gameplay content. Finally, at the higher pledge tiers, you'll get all kinds of bonus goodies, such as art packs, cosplay babe collabs, and more! --- [ FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ] Q:  Can I 'try before I buy'? A:  Yes, of course! To view our publicly-available content and demo versions, join our  public discord ! Q:  I pledged and became a patron - how do I join Discord? A:  You should receive a Discord invitation link to the email address you registered your Patreon account with! That invite will let you join our Discord channel. If you did not receive a Discord invite, please send a private message and I'll help you out ASAP!  Q:  I'm a patron! Where do I get my rewards? A:  As soon as you pledged, you will get an immediate invite to our Discord, where the various download links are stored! Our monthly polls are held via Patreon posts, and the Art Pack rewards are sent out near the end of each month via the Patreon messaging system! Q:  I am interested in commissioning a custom storyline/questline! How do I do that? A:  Our highest pledge tier will allow you to request a customized storyline, the accompanying CG set, and the accompanying sprite assets as well! You can do this once, for a sidequest, or pledge multiple times to have your ideas implemented into our games! Please send me a message before pledging to that tier, however, or we may have to refund you if we cannot accomodate your requests! There is also a hard limit on how many of these we can do! --- [ CREDITS ]  Here, I'd like to recognize all the people who have worked on the Dystopian Project and helped to make my dream a reality!  - Direction: Architect Additional Writing & Quest Design: だめだめ子 (DDKgirl), Animela - CG Artwork: Pigutao, Nikki-Nikky Concept Artwork: Pigutao, Nikki-Nikky, VSEVLEZ Systems Artist: Nikki-Nikky Environment Artist: Arsministrator Character Artwork: Arsministrator, Nikki-Nikky Additional Art Collabs/Contributions:  JiangShi, armandox, Ganassa, momdadno (MDN),  SacB0y,  Maxxiiee, Jingzy,  Keidiran, foxicube, pollenoxide, HunterWithAPen - Lead Programmer: Berd - Lead Audio:   SLAS Additional Audio:   VoiceLikeCandy, IRecshun - Executive Producers: Blue Oak, TinyHat Studios, Flips, Raclevisto, SweetJP, Ranthe Testing & Debugging Contributions: Looners, hweirdo, Alariza -  And last but not least, special thanks to our esteemed top supporters...

Welcome to my Patreon Page. \n\nIf you’re here, you probably know me already. But in case you\ndon’t, I’m David Cain, and I write a blog called Raptitude: Getting Better At\nBeing Human.   \n\nMy goal is to help people navigate the wondrous and turbulent\nexperience of being a human being. We’re all taking this long, strange trip together, and\nI think we should compare notes.   \n\nSo I share mine on the internet, and many of you share yours\ntoo, in comments and emails. That exchange is what Raptitude is\nall about. Join the Raptitude community   \n\nIf you like what I write and have found it helpful, please\nconsider supporting it by becoming a Patron. That means you pledge a small\namount of your choosing, as little as $2 a month, to help keep the lights on over my writing desk. In\nreturn, you'll get some lighthearted rewards and become a part of Raptitude's fan community.   \n\nOnce you become a Patron, you’ll get access to my private\nactivity feed, which contains such goodies as:  \n\n stray thoughts and reflections that didn’t make\nblog-post status  \n\n tiny poems I write exceptional things I find in obscure corners of the\ninternet occasional behind-the-scenes exclusives, like little videos\nof me wandering around my frozen Canadian hometown \n\n a place to discuss, collaborate, and bounce ideas off each other \n\nAt higher tiers there are more rewards: selections from my small fleet of ebooks, and\ndiscounts on Camp Calm and other things I’ve made. At certain tiers,  I’ll write\nyou a haiku poem  on any topic you choose, or  I'll make you a personalized card out of construction paper , or perhaps  we can even  get together for tea\nover Skype  and discuss philosophy or time-travel or anything you fancy.   \n\nYou can contribute at any level you like, and you can change\nor cancel your contribution any time.    \n\n Why Patreon? All creative work needs to be funded in one way or another,\nor else the creator can’t continue to do it. They must either put up a paywall,\nsurround the work with third-party ads, or infuse it with sponsored content. \n\nPatreon gives us a better option. It allows people who love\na creator’s work to support it  directly  and  voluntarily,  at a level that seems reasonable to them.   \n\nIf you value a thing someone is creating, you might decide\nto pay a small amount each month, if only to help ensure the continued creation of that\nthing. You decide what's reasonable. \n\nThis is a much better system for everyone, because the value\nexchange happens directly between creator and fan, rather than getting filtered through a\nthird-party advertiser that neither of us wants involved.  \n\nFor the monthly cost of a coffee—or if you're so inclined, a deluxe burrito—you will be supporting the work you\nlove, and freeing us all from The Man. Plus you’ll get access to some extra things,\nand become part of a community of fellow fans.   Patreon Support = More Raptitude Your contribution helps free up my time so that I can focus\non creating more and better things for you. With more time I can make more elaborate\nposts, including those ones with hand-drawn graphics, which are intensely\ntime-consuming but so much fun. Once this thing gets going, the sky’s the limit\n– a book, a podcast, a world tour? If you appreciate Raptitude and its message, consider becoming a member of our community. Whatever you can offer is graciously welcomed, and I'll do\nwhatever I can to make it worth your while. Thank you for sharing this journey\nwith me so far.   \n\n-David"},

My name is Elizabeth, and I  love  creating content for you over on my YouTube channel  Plant Based Bride !   My YouTube journey started around a decade ago, but this newest iteration began as I was planning my vegan minimalist and sustainable wedding to my (now) husband.  I launched a blog to write about my experiences and to create informative content about veganism to answer the common questions I received from friends and family. After two years and a wedding, I sort of felt like I'd run out of things to say.  At this point I'd begun posting Plan With Me videos on my channel each month to share my Bullet Journal journey with you, a journey I had begun years prior.  I took a break from creating regular content and only posted my monthly Bullet Journal videos for almost a year.  And in that year my YouTube channel grew faster than it ever had before! I realized I had a deep passion for Bullet Journaling and sharing tips and inspiration in this wonderfully kind and supportive community with all of you, and decided to shift the focus of my channel to revolve around Bullet Journaling with just a dash of my other interests (including mental health, sustainable living, and veganism). And all of this brings us to today.  I am currently creating weekly videos on my YouTube channel and almost daily content on Instagram.  But I want to be able to provide even more value for you!   Why Patreon?  As a big fan of bonus content and peeking behind the curtain to see the process of my favourite creators, I decided to create this  #PBBPatrons  community to further connect with all of you! This will not only allow me to share the behind the scenes of my process through exclusive patreon-only content, and give back with extra perks you can't get anywhere else, but it will also give me the peace of mind of a small guaranteed income every month.  By joining the  #PBBPatrons  squad you will be providing much-needed support so I can continue to upgrade my equipment to bring you higher quality content, offset the many hours spent planning, creating, and editing the videos I release each week, and allow me to continue to spoil my two fluffs in the manner to which they have become accustomed ;) Each and every patron brings me closer to my dream of creating beautiful things and spreading compassion, kindness, and awareness of the causes I hold near and dear, every single day of my life.   So,  thank you , from the very bottom of my heart!   How does this work? If you enjoy my content and want to support me further, you can join the  #PBBPatrons   squad and decide how much you'd like to pledge each month, from just $1.  Depending on your pledge you will unlock different levels of bonus patreon-only benefits!  You can change the amount of your pledge or cancel at any time. Every single pledge means the absolute world to me and I can't thank you enough for all of your love and support.  I don't know what I did to deserve such a beautiful community of souls in my little pocket of the internet, but I am incredibly grateful! I look forward to getting to know you even better here in the  #PBBPatrons community. With love,  xox Elizabeth  www.plantbasedbride.com  "},

For nearly 20 years, our business has existed to facilitate our art — and not the other way around. As we enter our third decade of existence, we feel that it’s time for a change in the way that we do business. As you may have heard, music is now more easily accessible than ever (nice!), it is also increasingly difficult for a traditional independent record label to be financially viable (dang!). Because people are buying less physical music these days, it is getting harder and harder to fund the big, daring projects that you have come to expect from us, and that we expect from ourselves. And all of this was before COVID-19, which, by making performing and touring impossible in the foreseeable future, has taken away the main source of income for most artists. For Doomtree to come out the other side of this pandemic and continue to be fearless and independent, we're asking you to play a bigger part in our story than ever before.

All documents that have a  public version  are available. We are dedicated to helping those that want to bring more diversity to the art of gaming. We will do this by sponsoring attendance at diverse gaming conventions, promoting those that are making diverse games, indie projects and presenting on the topics of diversity in gaming at conventions. So  please support our work on Patreon,  even $1 per month will help. One of our goals is to have  more articles, to pay people for their contributions, and to do more tangible things for the community. We also want to help others get to conventions, share their work if funding is an issue. We would love your support to send aspiring game devs to conventions like GDC, IGDA events in their city, GeekGirlCon,FlameCon, GaymerX, HavenCon, VectorConf, East Coast Games Conference, and other places where gaming and diversity are part of the conversation. We want to do this by highlighting work by marginalized, underrepresented people in the industry, getting their voices heard and their work seen be it a game, articles, etc. But that takes resources and time. Our founder does this full time, others give what time they can to moderate our spaces, and dedicate our time to better diversifying the games space. So in the meantime, we humbly ask for your support to do the work we can and to bring change to the art form we love and want to make better! Thank you so much for whatever support you can give towards our work. Cheers, Tanya D. aka cypheroftyr @cypheroftyr // @INeedDivGms  [email protected] Our purpose and mission: The Mission of I Need Diverse Games: I Need Diverse Games via all associated platforms and members; including but not limited to: twitter, Facebook, Google+,  and other mediums seeks to bring projects, works and research by marginalized folks to light. We also seek to discuss, analyze and critique identity and culture in video games through a multi-faceted lens rooted in intersectionality How we achieve our Mission and Goals: Participating in the Game Developers Conference Scholarship program which sends 25 people to GDC, one of the most important professional development conferences in the games industry. Each scholar gets an All Access Pass, a $2000 USD value given to us each year by the conference to assist those who would normally be unable to attend due to the cost. Publishing articles on diversity in games who would otherwise not have a voice on issues relevant to them in the works they see and others create. We pay contributors for their work. Work with other conferences and conventions to provide passes, free of charge to attendees that would normally not be able to attend events such as GaymerX, OrcaCon, HavenCon, AlterConf and others due to monetary issues Speak at conventions on issues of diversity as relevant to our mission and goals. Or assist others in going to conventions to attend such talks and panels. Participate in Diversity and Inclusion focused activities at conventions & conferences, and offer volunteer opportunities so community members can attend such events while assisting with our table. Purpose: Provide a safe online space for gamers of color and gamers of any other marginalized identities (including race, gender, sexual orientation, neurodiversity, disability, etc.) to discuss, promote, and educate for inclusion within the gaming industry and games themselves. Promote the work of creators in the gaming industry, including journalists, developers, artists that are marginalized and would otherwise go unheard. Encourage and defend diversity in all forms of gaming, and most importantly, make sure it is done right, by creating conversations that invite both critique and praise for the art of gaming. Promote posts on social media and online publications that use a sociological lens to talk about video, tabletop and other forms of games as well as gaming culture, posts that raise awareness of PoC activism and independent projects, and posts that discuss the future of games as a form of media. Maintain journalistic integrity, as well as accountability, in the discussion of the need for diverse gaming with the goals of education and growth in that community. We view diversity as a way to enrich the video game experience, not a quota to be filled, or a tool to avoid criticism.

We've been creating together since high school, originally inspired to start because of the manga and anime we loved when we were young. While we still adore those things, we've broadened our influences to film, television, music, and sometimes even  real life  (gasp). Needless to say, our tastes have changed a bit. But our goal hasn't! We still, and always will, want to write the most awesome comics we can 😊 We're mostly known for our beautiful gals,  ❤ LUCIA ❤   and ❤ MIA ❤ , and the homie  🦀 ALFREDO THE CRAB🦀 . Lucia was originally the star of our first  of our first webcomic,  The Panty Bear , while Mia and Alfredo are just OCs we created for fun. All three of 'em have blossomed into something we've never imagined, and we're stoked y'all love 'em. THANK YOU🎉 Patreon is our main source of income. By supporting this, you support us living out our dream of making comics full-time and allow us to create more and more ambitious projects. Basically, you're absolutely awesome and we love you💖💖💖 But we hate the idea of people paying for something and not getting anything exclusive in return. So, that's why we offer plenty of  BEHIND-THE-SCENES ,  SIDE STORIES ,and  EXTRA LORE  content for past projects,  UPDATES  on current projects, access to  HIGH-RES TWITTER VERSIONS  of Scott's Twitter posts, and, of course,  SPICY LEWDS EVERY WEEK. We never delete  anything  from this Patreon except for early update posts for currently ongoing projects. Meaning that, when you subscribe, you will get access to  everything  we've ever posted. Every lewd, every one of Scott's twitter posts, etc. We believe in giving people as much content as possible, and hope to make it the best quality we can.   OTHER PLACES YOU CAN FIND US 📚 TWITTER:   Both of us have Twitters, but  Bryce  is mostly inactive on his.  Scott's  is where you can see tons of our content. Lucia pose sheets, Mia pose sheets, etc.  DISCORD:   We also have a 11,000+ member  Discord  community! We are both very active on there, and love interacting with so many beautiful people. There are plenty of incredible artists there, too! The Discord is  NOT  Patreon exclusive. There are a few Patreon Exclusive  channels , but aside from that it is totally open! WEBCOMICS:  Our only public comic, as of right now, is The Panty Bear. It's a wacky action comic about evil plushies and super-powered panties! You can read it on  Webtoons  or our  website .

Everything changed when I first discovered Touchdesigner five years ago. I became addicted in a short time and I set a goal to become good at it, to ease my effort to find a job in this field. At the same time, the idea of doing tutorials and sharing something with the community from which I learned a ton, came up. So here I am, spending a lot of time on this, researching new ways of visual programming. I run the  paketa12  youtube channel where I make tutorials on generative design.

However you've found me, thanks for stopping by and I hope you enjoy my work.  Speaking of which... I'm on Patreon because making a living writing about, researching or illustrating fossil animals - even really cool ones - is not always easy. It amounts to being a specialist freelancer, which means paying projects can be rare, workloads are unpredictable, and vast spans of time can exist between being paid (e.g. book royalties are only paid annually). Patreon is one solution to this. As a crowd-funding scheme for online creatives, it gives you a method to support your favourite authors and artists with micropayments each month. In return for your money, you get access to exclusive content and rewards. The more you pledge, the more you receive in rewards: prints, books and so on. But for starters, a $1 per month donation entitles you to: In-progress and exclusive artwork related to upcoming books, blog posts and papers 'Behind the scenes' insights into creative projects Insights into new research Excerpts from upcoming books Competitions Your pledges support the production of my art and writing, enabling me to tackle more detailed and involved projects, produce content at a higher rate, and improve the quality of what I can produce. Hopefully, this will make what I'm doing more sustainable for me, and more interesting for you: to that end,  any  donation you can offer, however small, is hugely appreciated. Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy my Patreon feed if you take the plunge. Dr. Mark Witton"},

I've worked as\na fantasy fiction editor in New York City, directed a mythic arts\norganization in Boston, co-founded an arts retreat in the Arizona\ndesert, and now live in a small English village on Dartmoor, surrounded by artists and sheep. I work from \n The   Bumblehill Studio , my faithful hound usually curled up beside me; and I write a daily blog about myth, art, and nature, called \n Myth & Moor . \n \nI've won nine World Fantasy Awards, the Mythopoeic Award, the Bram\nStoker Award, and the SFWA Solstice Award for \"outstanding\ncontributions to the speculative fiction field as a writer, editor,\nartist, educator, and mentor.\" I've been short-listed twice for the Shirley Jackson Award, and once for the Tiptree.\n \n \n \n \nThe work I'm best known for:\n \n \nIn the field of fantasy literature, most people know me best as an editor and anthologist. In the 1980s, I was the senior editor for fantasy at Ace Books, created a young adult\nfantasy line for Ace/Tempo Books, and then worked as a consulting fantasy editor\nfor Tor Books for two decades thereafter. Over the years I've published\nthe first novels and stories of many writers who have gone on to be major\nfigures in the field; and helped to nuture the modern\nrenaissance of \n fairy tale literature  for adult readers. I've also\nchampioned the short story form by publishing over \n 30 anthologies ,\nincluding 16 volumes of \n The Year's Best Fantasy & Horror  series\n(with Ellen Datlow). \n \n \nFrom 1987 to 2008, I ran The\nEndicott Studio for Mythic Art, which supported writers, artists, and\nscholars working with myth, folklore and fairy tales. Projects\nincluded \n The Armless Maiden  anthology, the award-winning  Journal of Mythic Arts  (published from 1997 to 2008), and The Endicott West Arts Retreat.\nRun as a nonprofit, all Endicott proceeds supported charities for\nabused, homeless, and \"at risk\" children. In 2008 I launched  Myth & Moor  (short-listed for the World Fantasy Award), and in the years since I've continued to work with fantasy and myth in a range of ways, including editing, lecturing, and as a member of the  Modern Faeries  research project (sponsored by Oxford and Sheffield Universities). \n \n \n \n The\nwork I love best:\n   \n \nI feel honored and privileged to have edited and mentored so many fine writers over the years -- but the work I love best is writing myself, and creating art based on my own stories. \n \n \nI've published one adult novel, \n The Wood Wife  (winner of the\nMythopoeic Award), along with five small books for children, a handful of\nnovellas and stories, and many, many articles and essays\non myth, folklore, fairy tales, fantasy literature and other magical\nart forms. I've also created folkloric paintings, drawings, and collages, which have been published, printed, and exhibited in museums\nand galleries in US and Europe.\n \n \nWriting and art take time, however, and editing is what pays the bills -- thus my writing output is woefully slow, and I'm determined to make that change. I want to cut severely back on editing now in order to focus on writing and painting...and bring all the stories inside of me out onto the page and into the world. \n \n \nWhy Patreon?\n \n \nI entered the publishing field in a very different era -- before the internet, ebooks, Amazon, and other factors changed the industry in myriad ways. Back then, it was still possible for a  midlist   writer to make a modest living from her work -- while today, most of us need to find at least part of our income from another source. I like the idea of Patreon because it enables readers to support the writers they want to read and illustrators whose work they want to see more of, facilitating the creation of books and other projects that would otherwise not exist.  \n \nI believe deeply in the power of community -- so community funding that allows creators to create is a powerful and beautiful thing.    \n \n \n \n \n Why now?  \n \nFirst of all I'm not getting any younger, so time to devote to my own writing and painting is feeling increasingly urgent. I have books-in-progress I want to\ncomplete, ideas for others filling up my notebooks, half-finished\npaintings on my work table, and every that day I neglect them feels like a betrayal of the tales I have to tell. \n \n \nSecond, the energy I use to do my work is limited by\nhealth issues that I've had since I was young. I have good days and I\nhave bad days. I'm a disciplined worker, and I labor very hard on the\ngood days to make up for the bad -- but this too has impacted my\ncreative output. When I'm working hard as an editor, there's little\nenergy for anything else.\n \n \nMy\nfriends have urged me to try Patreon, to see if\nit this model of community-funded art will work for me -- allowing me\nto  turn more of my time over to writing and painting.\n \n \n \n \n \n Work in progress: \n \n* \n The Moon Wife : a novel for adult readers (loosely connected to  The Wood Wife )\n about artists from Pre-Raphaelite times to the present, steeped in \nfairies and fairy tales. I'm in the second draft stage on this -- but it\n still needs a lot of work due to being a long and complex narrative. * A lightly illustrated novel for Middle Grade readers (8-to-12-year-olds) set in a magical version of rural Devon, involving my \"bunny girl\" and animal spirit characters. I'm close to completion of the first draft of the book, which doesn't yet have a title. The next step will be a tighter second draft, along with design and illustration roughs.  \n \n* \n A Story of Stories : a collection of my essays on folklore, fairy tales, and fantasy. The essays have all been written, but I'm editing them and writing interstitial material which weaves them all together. \n \n* \"Rat and Blade\" and other novellas for the \n Bordertown  series (urban fantasy for teen readers), co-authored with  Ellen Kushner .  \n \n \n \n \n What patron funding is used for: \n \n* \n Work time: \n Although my small family lives very modestly in a tiny house at the edge of the moor, England is an expensive country to live in -- plus I have extra costs of supplementary health-care, and high vet bills for our dog Tilly (who has an auto-immune disease kept in check by monthly medication that costs the moon). Patreon funding helps to cover my share of household costs, and medical costs, so that I can stop editing and start writing. \n \n*  Office assistance:  Working alone, my days are often swallowed up by the admin work involved with publishing -- leaving me with little time for the creative work itself. Since autumn 2019, however, Patreon funds have allowed me to hire an editorial assistant, Lunar Hine, to work with me several hours a week. This has been an  enormous  blessing. (More information  here .) *  Specific writing and art projects :  Once the above expenses are securely covered, I have a number of specific book projects I'd like to get cracking on.  Please see the Stretch Goals panel (on the left) for more information. On the art side of my work, additional funding would allow me make new cards & prints, publish an annual calendar, and update my studio tools -- enabling me to get more artwork out into the world, \nin printed and original forms.  \n \n \n \nMy promise to you:\n \n \nIf\nyou choose to become a patron of the Bumblehill Studio, I promise you I will put my\nheart and soul into making works of fiction and art inspired by folklore, fairy tales, the natural world, and my personal history. \n \n \n\"Everything is held together with stories,\" says the great American writer \n Barry Lopez . \"That is all that is holding us together, stories and compassion.\" \n \n \nI couldn't agree more.\n \n \n \n"},

If you're reading this, chances are you know me as Chris from the  website  (and  Facebook community ) Autistic Not Weird: former primary school teacher turned autism speaker/blogger/author. What I do: Having left teaching and started Autistic Not Weird in April 2015, I have since  delivered speaking engagements  nationwide (including for the NHS, the National Autistic Society, mainstream/special school staff teams and students, the 2016-2020 Autism Shows, counselling teams and so on), and internationally for Autism Awareness Australia and India Autism Centre. My website, Autistic Not Weird, has received over 2,500,000 page hits and nearly 130,000 Facebook followers (at time of writing), while  the \"Underdogs\" series , endorsed by Steve Silberman and Michael Grant (and positively reviewed by  The Guardian !), is two books through its series so far, with a third in its pre-order stage. Before Patreon, this was all achieved during my spare time- in spite of me being occupied by three jobs, a masters degree, captaincy of my local Boys' Brigade, and various offline commitments to people I love. Now, thanks to my Patreon supporters, I have been able to quit a job and devote whole working days per week to writing for Autistic Not Weird! What I plan to do: I now intend for my autism advocacy to become a viable full-time career, which is absolutely possible with the right support. Autistic Not Weird is now literally a part-time job, and the more secure my income is, the more safely I can commit to spending my days doing the following: Working on Autistic Not Weird as both an educational site and a supportive community; Providing advice and consultancy to those who request help from me; Producing more helpful content for  Autistic Not Weird's YouTube channel ; Publishing more books to promote understanding of autism; Providing more seminars and training sessions, nationally and internationally. It's also worth mentioning that I have monthly \"supervision\" sessions with a therapist for my work with Autistic Not Weird, as it often involves very sensitive work with vulnerable people. These sessions are funded entirely by my Patreon followers, who I am eternally grateful to for enabling me to access the support I need. How Patreon works: Patreon is typically used as a way for an artist/musician's fanbase to gain support from their supporters. This allows them to worry less about where their next meal is coming from, and focus more on actually doing the job they love. Pledges are made using the right-hand column, in exchange for a variety of rewards and perks! And finally... To those who have read to the end, thank you very much- and thank you too for the support who have provided to the Autistic Not Weird community: whether you are a frequent poster or have simply read an article or two. Please consider supporting this Patreon venture: with enough support, I will be able to spend the rest of my days writing, speaking and publishing to support the worldwide autism community. Thanks again, Chris Bonnello http://autisticnotweird.com https://www.facebook.com/autisticnotweird https://www.youtube.com/AutisticNotWeird https://chrisbonnello.com/ - One final important note: A number of people have asked me if there's a one-off donation option. Patreon itself doesn't do one-offs, but I can certainly receive donations via PayPal. If you send me a message (via here or Facebook) I'd happily give you the details!"},

My steadily growing etsy business became a great source of comfort to me - being able to gain an income from something I did independently sparked a sense of pride, agency, and joy I had never felt before.  Almost a year later, I have made it a huge goal of mine to become a  self-employed freelance  artist! I decided to open this Patreon page in order to create a space where people can  directly support me and my work  and get some fun benefits along the way! (Podcasts, sticker mail, prints, digital downloads, Q&A's, etc.) I also hope this can be a space where I share some more personal stories, milestones in my art journey, and just fun bits and bobs of my life (I'm trying to become a ceramicist one day!)  By supporting my Patreon, you're letting me live my dream of being an independent artist and make work that resonates with me 100%.  I'm so so so thankful for your support.  SO HOW DOES IT WORK? You can make a pledge to a specific tier, and then receive the benefits of that tier!  You will be charged when you sign up, and then from then on, on the first of every month.  While you're doing so much to support me, I also want this patreon community to be beneficial to you too! I hope through some fun content + helpful resources, I can make your pledge \"worth it.\" :)  *For all physical benefits, you will receive the reward for the month you pledge for. For example, if you sign up any time during the month of June, you'll receive June's benefits. I will ship them out during the middle and the end of the month!! Whether or not you choose to pledge, and however long you choose to pledge for, thank you so much for being here and I hope to see you around on the interwebs ~  x Megan"},

Si els catalans no s’avesen a pagar pel material de qualitat, el país difícilment podrà participar amb veu pròpia al debat sobre la democràcia que la globalització ha plantejat el món. Fins fa poc, els nivells d’alfabetització marcaven les diferències en la marxa dels països. En la societat del coneixement les diferències vindran marcades per la capacitat dels ciutadans de pensar fora dels marcs establerts i filtrar bé els continguts per protegir-se de la propaganda i dels algoritmes digitals.  L’estil és el criteri que no es pot falsificar i, per refinar l'estil i tenir bones idees, els escriptors necessitem que ens paguin per la nostra feina com es paga als lampistes, els cirurgians i els assessors bancaris.

I have a 10 dollar tier where I sell monthly bases you can vote on. There are some other bonuses that come with subscribing, but this is the main offer of my Patreon, like a subscription service that helps support me! 10 USD tier: 2 bases every month  - This is what my 10 dollar tier is for. You will get a full-body base, as well as a matching chibi or more simplified/stylized base (something easier to make a large batch of adopts with). You can use these for adoptables, auctions, trades, commissions (like taking design commissions on the base), or personal use. Voting for the monthly base begins at the start of the month! I may also release \"bonus\"  bases unrelated to the winning option. All of these bases are exclusive to Patreon and will not be sold off-site. Subscribing will instantly give you access to the bases. Sticking around will give you new ones every month and you can vote! Early previews of adoptables  + a general time they get uploaded for sale (for example, I may say, Tomorrow around noon Pacific time), and occasional Patreon only adopts. I do adopts almost every month so you'll get a preview at least once a month. Rules for Bases! You may use them for: adoptables (flat sale or auction style), commissions, trades, gifts, personal art. You may price them whatever you would like.  You may edit the lines as much as you would like. You can change species, do add ons, splice bases, etc. No limits Only main rule: please do not redistribute without permission Bonuses Occasional Patreon only commissions. Please note this is NOT guaranteed monthly, because I don't do regular commissions anymore.  Occasional process / timelapse videos directly from Procreate (the program I draw on). These don't get shared anywhere else. A chance at a monthly free request!  Not everyone has access to a request every month due to the amount of my subs so, please consider this a small bonus! You get a chance at a free sketchy full-body design* that is yours to keep. I usually do at least 12+ a month.  *any designs you receive from my Patron (buying, free requests, etc) can be resold / auctioned / up for offers for ANY value Below are examples of some of the bases I've done during 2021-2022!"},

We are  GamingOnLinux.com , what we commonly refer to a \"GOL\"! It's a completely independent gaming website, dedicated to Linux and Steam Deck / SteamOS gaming. We find the news and chase down developers, so you don't have to! We write new articles  almost  every day for you to keep up with everything around Linux / SteamOS gaming. In the past, you might have picked up a monthly gaming magazine, by pledging to us you could consider it like that, except you're also getting everything else we do as well.  Liam from GamingOnLinux (the owner) has written about Linux news for many years. Liam was the original gaming writer for the old  Linux Voice  magazine (R.I.P). You can see a  horrible  picture in many of their early issues. Here's more of what we do: We also track tons of  crowdfunded games , so you don't have to search around. We track plenty of  statistics about Steam . We run a  community forum . There's  even a Wiki ! Articles not your thing? We are also on  Twitch  and  YouTube ! On top of that, we also run the  Linuxers Reddit ,\n a subreddit designed to be a friendly and inviting place for old and \nnew Linux users alike. Don't like Reddit? Try out Lemmy, it's an open \nsource alternative and we also moderate  the linux_gaming Lemmy community . Want to know how much we've done on the site, or what anyone else has done on it? You can hit  this link . You will see there the amount of effort we put into it every month! The code that runs GOL is  open source  under the MIT license ( gitlab ). We chose that license so that anyone can tinker with it re-use it and generally do whatever they like without any licensing hassles.  It's really only meant for GOL though, but hey if an issue bugs you, why not help out ;) \n Payments \nYou can pledge any amount you want from $1 to $\n whatever . It's your choice, you don't even need to pick a reward. We appreciate it no matter what! \n \nPayments are taken once a month around the 1st of each month. \n We've enabled up-front payments, so you're charged for the first time\n when you initially subscribe and then again on the 1st of each month.  If you up your pledge, it will also be taken instantly! How to get supporter status to show up on the website When you've paid each month, simply  go to this page and login with Patreon . It will refresh your account and give you supporter status. \n \n What to expect from this Patreon \nWhile most of the work goes into writing articles and working on the websites code, we will be throwing out information early to certain Patreon supporters on what we're working on. You will also have a direct say in what we do next. We will be involving you in the process of our work, as much as possible. We will also give you sneak peeks at things before they are ready to go on the website.\n You also get the few special extras as noted on the tiers, like a promise of no adverts for you (ever!) if you are at least at the \"Supporter\" ($4) level.

It features a collection of over 4000 books written by Black women, creative workshops, author interviews, craft talks, film screenings, critical conversation, and a Reading Club that meets over Zoom one to two times a month. The library invites readers of all ages, races, and genders to come and check out the collection, enjoy the space, as well as trade good books written by Black women. The library provides a space for reading, writing, rest, community building, and connection.  Through this work, I illustrate the transformative power of books and community, while lifting up the brilliance, creativity, and diversity within Black womanhood.  In 2022 we launch our Reading Room, a storefront that will contain our book collection and serve as a literary hub and creative co-working space for the community.  Patreon funds are used to cover the labor, expenses, and supplies needed to run The Free Black Women's Library. TFBWL patrons are the MVPs of this project and the main reason it continues to exist.  In this space - I share behind the scenes details about the running of the library, book reviews, author interviews, personal essays, short stories, creative resources, TFBWL audio archives, and book lists.  Patrons also receive free weekly yoga sessions held over Zoom every Sunday at 10 am Eastern Time. These are one-hour sessions focusing on building strength, flexibility, and balance.  Thank you so much for being here, please feel free to message me with any questions you may have about my work.  Welcome to the family and enjoy the ride!!  xoxo 🌹 Ola "},

I have developed and continue to study a form of equine and human education called Freedom Based Training®, or FBT. This training method and the films I have made in the process of my research have been all based on a few intriguing questions. What if horses were given a choice and a voice? Would they let us ride them?  Without force or tools to control and without bribes to lure them? What started as simple questions, birthed the first movie, Taming Wild and an online course for students interested in learning Freedom Based Training®. I draw on a long and diverse history with horses as I continue to research, develop and film documentaries. All of this has gathered together amazing people from around the globe who also seek their own answers in what it takes to work more collaboratively with horses. As tends to happen, questions birth more questions, and so I continue on this Taming Wild journey with a second film in post production and a third movie about to start filming, a book soon to be out, and an ever-growing community of brilliant minds exploring ideas with me. What does it take to truly work together in freedom? Please join the community and help us ask the questions, which take us to the answers that make the world a better place for equines and humans together everywhere. Hooves and Heartbeats,  Elsa \n"},

Patreon funds will be invested in what you see on the screen. I would like to upgrade my equipment for a start, and get some technical help. I would also like to invest in getting subtitles added. I don’t think viewers should be excluded who don’t speak English. And I would of course LOVE to make a living out of just making these videos. Your donation would help to keep Great Art explained going, and keep it free for everyone.  I am passionate about art and I believe that everyone should know more about it.  Art IS complicated, but I hope to be able to help you sift through all the mass of information and unnecessary art jargon, and come out after fifteen minutes with some understanding of what makes a masterpiece.  Art has liberated me, made me question the world, moved me, made me laugh  and  cry, and expanded my soul. Art can be thrilling if you allow it to be. And I want to help others get as much from it as I do.  Art, particularly contemporary art, often feels intimidating, and people often look on art history as something complicated, but it is simple: Art is a mirror of our society. It reflects the culture of the time, so by studying art, it can help you understand the culture and its time. It is how people across the ages have communicated non-verbally, and its what makes us human. How many times have I heard \"The Mona Lisa is a cliché\" or about Picasso, \"My five year old can do that\". But it is  how  you look at the work, place it in its context and have some understanding of the history.  I don't want you to love every artwork I make a film about, but I do want you to think about it. What is art if it does not challenge you? It's decoration.  Art history is full of so many amazing stories of creation: Monet's Water Lilies and WWI, The assault of Artemisia Gentileschi that inspired her Judith, The peculiar block of marble that shaped Michelangelo's David. Stories that in and of themselves, are inspirational.  I don't expect people to know  everything  about the Spanish civil war, but I hope my video conveys how important it was for Picasso in the creation of Guernica.  Then I want to show you a little bit about technique. How did artists make these materials work for them and in what ways. And why? I am not trying to re-invent the wheel, I am however trying to declutter the complicated codes and linguistic traps that are designed to keep us in the dark.  Something about me. I was lucky enough to be born in a city (London), where museums have free admission. So from a young age I would jump on a bus, and head to art galleries alone (helicopter parenting didn't exist yet). In school holidays, I would spend hours in the Tate, or the national gallery or the British Museum. Still to this day, I love visiting museums alone, with no distractions, to let the art sink into my body and soul.  Classical art was what interested me, but I clearly remember seeing the Rothko room at the Tate for the first time at thirteen. Obviously I didn't understand it, and it confused me, disturbed me, and shocked me. A few weeks later, I was back again, curious as to why I was still thinking about them, and this time there was a guided tour going on in the Rothko room. I listened to the woman, whose passion for Rothko was almost palpable. The thing was, she wasn't spouting complicated theory, she was telling a story. That is what sparked an interest. I didn't fall in love with the paintings, I fell in love with the story.   It made me want to learn more about New York, about where he came from, and why he made the choices he did. It gave me a springboard to learn about the art.  I still feel the same way about Michelangelo, and Raphael, and Goya, and Agnes Martin. I want to know more. I want to be informed about why their work has meaning to them. I finally studied Fine Art (at Central St. Martin's) in my thirties. I studied to be an artist, but I ended up more and more, curating. I eventually co-owned a gallery (PayneShurvell) in London, which we eventually closed, as London rental prices are exorbitant.  I still curate and write about art for various websites.  My main job (that pays the bills) is as a European history guide for a travel company. Obviously the pandemic finished that off.  And that's when I started making these videos. Which I am still learning to make. I had no idea I needed a mic when I started - or even what a pop filter was!  Videos for me work, because art is a visual medium. I know that when I watch art history videos I get frustrated when it is just a talking head, or just the same picture throughout. I need more visuals, I am a visual person. Great Art Explained is an art channel, so I spend hours looking for the perfect visual. That is the artist side of me.  I cannot believe how many subscribers I have, and how many views my videos get. It blows my mind, that something I love to do, is watched by so many. I am still learning and hope you can join me on that journey.  I'd love your support so I can invest in my channel, but don't worry if you can't, just keep watching and learning. And enjoying!  Thanks for your time!  James "},

I'm drawing comics about our current catastrophe. It's intense work that I love doing, but unfortunately, given the nature of the art and the amount of time each piece takes to produce, outlets are few and compensation is not sustainable. And so I'm reaching out to my beloved readers!  I would love to be able to continue to illustrate what's happening without having to worry about publication, media outlet remuneration, and uhh debilitating hunger. Rewards, you ask?  It turns out I have a huge amount of stuff to share!! From works in progress to background contexts to art drafts to photo source materials and image studies (depending on how many pics of my hand modeling you'd be interested in), from high-res JPEGS for personal use to postcards in your mailbox once a month or drawings of *you* once a year, there's something for just about everybody who wants to support the most graphic of arts. I hope you'll be able to contribute with a mind towards sustaining this sort of art in an increasingly barren mediascape.  With your help I can continue making work that helps galvanize the Left and piss off some of the worst human beings on the planet.

FIND OUT MORE HERE \n▶ MUCH easier built-in navigation of the tutorials ▶ Cheaper monthly subscription in comparison to Patreon \n▶ 30-day money back guarantee so you can decide if the Academy is right for you \n▶ The option to join the \"Platinum - Postcard/Voting\" tier level where you will receive a physical postcard art print each month and have the chance to vote for next month's tutorials \n▶ Save the tutorials to your \"Favourites\" to make it easier to come back to later \n▶ In-built private community group (similar to a Facebook group) where only members of the Academy can post and comment \n▶ Option to join a monthly OR annual membership (you get two months free if you join the annual option!) \n▶ and more! \nI will still be uploading regular tutorials to Patreon so if you would still like to join Patreon (or are a member already) there's no need to worry! If you are a member of Patreon and would like to switch over to the KR Fine Art Academy but have a few questions, click here to read through the FAQ or contact me! \n -------- \n \n Welcome to Patreon! \nI’m Kirsty Rebecca and I create drawing and painting tutorials that are easy to follow, so you can create realistic and professional artwork, even if you’re just starting out! \n \nIf you'd like to improve your drawing and painting skills even further, then my Patreon channel is the solution for you!\n \n \n \n \nFor a small amount per month , you will have access to every tutorial I've previously uploaded on your chosen tier level in a variety of mediums like pastel, coloured pencil, charcoal, watercolour, and more! \n \nI have tutorials available for a range of subjects like wildlife, birds, landscapes, still life, flowers and portraits.\n \n \nNot only are my tutorials full-length, real-time, and fully narrated with clear instructions and explanations, but you will also have access to the original reference photo, a traceable outline, and a list of supplies including the exact colour names I'm using so you can relax and follow along, every step of the way!\n \n \n \n \nEvery month, I upload brand new tutorials to the Patreon library so you can grow and develop your drawing and painting skills, and take your art to the next level!\n \n \nYou can also join our Facebook group where you can ask questions or advice, share your artwork, and talk to other members of the Patreon community!\n \n \nThere are no lock-in contracts so you can upgrade or downgrade to a different tier level, or you can cancel your pledge at any time if Patreon isn't right for you, so why not give it a go?\n \n \n ** T ake a look at the library of Patreon tutorials you will have immediate access to when you join us on Patreon here!** \n \n  Take advantage of the Beginner's Section!  This section will give you the knowledge you need to get started! \n \nYou will learn how to choose your own reference photos and how to edit your references to help with the drawing process. I will also show you how to choose your colours, create an accurate outline, and give you some projects I recommend that you start with! \n \nThe tutorials in this section will help you understand the process and decision-making of drawing and painting so you can follow along with any of my larger projects, or choose a reference to draw from on your own! \n \n  Relax and Enjoy some REPS sessions!    (You will find these at the bottom of the Patreon Tutorial Library) \n R = Relax Take some time to relax, enjoy drawing, listen to some music, a podcast, the birds outside, your favourite audiobook... or just enjoy the silence! You can follow along with me, use the video for inspiration, or use the \"prompt\" to find your own reference photo to draw! The goal is to get comfy and have some fun sketching! \n E = Experiment Use this time to experiment with new mediums, new subjects, new papers, or new techniques! \nDon't get too caught up in a \"perfect\" end result - Play around and try new things! \n P = Practice \nThis is a fantastic time to practice any of your weak points! Whether that's freehanding, drawing certain subjects, colour mixing, value studies, or different textures - this is a safe space to give yourself permission to \"have a go\" without feeling the need to create a \"masterpiece\"! \n S = Sketch Remember these are supposed to be quicker \"sketches\" rather than completed drawings! Try setting a time limit and see what you can get done in that time frame! \n...Or take as long as you want - it's up to you - this is supposed to be relaxing and fun :) \n \nR.E.P.S sessions are *BONUS* silent videos! There is a full list of supplies in the description, along with the reference photos I have used... However, there is no voiceover instruction. These videos are in real-time, so you can still see every step of the sketching process! They are also simple enough for you to follow along (without instruction) if you wish! \n \n  Struggling to find the supplies I have listed in my tutorials? Trust me, I know your pain!  \nI have Amazon links to all of the supplies I am using for those living in the US/UK/AU But if you are living somewhere without an Amazon site (or you can't get the supplies you need from Amazon) it can be quite hard to find certain supplies... Pastelmat for example! Jackson's is a UK-based art supply store, that actually ships worldwide (some of their products are cheaper than what I can get in Australia, so the shipping is worth it!) I have a full list of all the supplies I use, with direct links to each product from Jackson's here https://www.kirstyrebeccafineart.com/supplylists AND if you purchase ANYTHING from Jackson's after clicking any of my links, you'll receive 10% off your entire first order! \n \n \n  How do the payments work?    Once you've chosen your tier level and joined Patreon, you will have immediate access to all of the benefits for your tier level! \n \nAs a new patron, your payment will be processed on the day you become a patron, then on that SAME DATE each month going forward* *This is a NEW feature as of Sept 2022 - Previously, you would have been charged on the date you join, then on the 1st of each month going forward (even if you joined on the 30th, you would have been charged again on the 1st) \n  What if you change your mind?    That is totally okay! \n \nOn a monthly membership, you can easily upgrade, downgrade or cancel your pledge or cancel at any time via your Patreon Account settings. \n \n  Sharing/selling your artwork created from the tutorials  Generally, most artists who create online tutorials do not allow you to sell your work, enter any competitions, or claim it as your own in any way. You are allowed to use the tutorials as practice – and that’s all. \n \nThe main reasons why people have these “rules” is because they have either used their own reference photos for their tutorials (or have paid for the reference so they have the right to use the photo – but their students don’t) and also because people generally don’t like it when other people copy their work and claim it as their own \n \nHowever, I am not as fussed as some other people about some of these “rules” \n \nSo, to answer some of your questions; \n \n Can I share the artwork I created by following one of your tutorials online? (to Facebook/Instagram/your own website etc) \n\t \n\t I purposely use free royalty-free reference photos, so you won’t have any legal copyright issues if you upload your work online… BUT please don’t claim it as your own work. I have seen quite a lot of posts recently on social media that are almost an exact replica of my artwork (which is great – I love seeing the work you create from the tutorials) but the artist is basically claiming that they came up with the idea, techniques, colour choices, backgrounds etc. \n\t\t The courteous, fair, respectful, and honest thing to do is to credit the teacher when you post your artwork online if you follow a tutorial. For example, you can simply add “tutorial by Kirsty Rebecca Fine Art” at the bottom of your post \n\t\t\t Can I enter the artwork I created by following one of your tutorials in a competition or show (online or in-person)? \n\t\t\t\t\tNo. This is actually because competitions require you to enter “original artwork”. So understandably, if you copy one of my tutorials, you (along with many others) would have created copies of the same piece of artwork, that I originally created – therefore you would be breaking competition “rules” \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Can I sell the artwork I created by following one of your tutorials? \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI don’t have any issues with you selling your work created from the tutorials – just remember to credit the teacher (myself) by adding “tutorial by Kirsty Rebecca Fine Art” to your website listing/social media post etc when you advertise it for sale \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHopefully, this makes things a little clearer!  How can you contact me?  If you have any questions about the tiers, payments or Patreon in general, you are welcome to email me at  [email protected] \n \n ---- \n \nThank you for considering supporting me on Patreon! \n \n"},

Thank you for stopping by my Patreon page, my name is Samuel Earp, a traditional realism artist who loves to paint landscapes, especially scenes of New Zealand, Australia and Guernsey among others. I was born on the island of Guernsey in 1979 but grew up in the South-West of England where I did a lot of drawing and painting from an early age, I always loved landscape art even as a child. I moved to the beautiful country of New Zealand in 2009 and have been there ever since. I am an artist who not only loves to paint landscapes but I also love to teach painting. You may have seen some of my videos on YouTube or my written painting tutorials on my website blog. Painting is my passion and I would like to be able to continue to make a living from my art and help artists such as yourself to improve your painting skills. I'd love to have you along with me on my art journey. Please consider subscribing to my Patreon page for in-depth painting tutorials, art tips and exclusive content."},

My name is Brian Patterson. I am a cartoonist, cartographer, and a life-long fan of roleplaying games. I began my comics career with d20Monkey way back in 2010, but in early 2015, I took the big leap into making d20Monkey, cartography, and freelance illustration my full-time job. Five years later, and after 10 years of creating d20Monkey, I brought the series of its finale (which you can put your eyeballs on  right here ). Now I am in a new chapter of my career where I balance cartography and illustration work in the TTRPG industry with my comics work. The transition brings new challenges and goals, but I am loving the work and I hope to make it a sustainable career for many years to come. Your support here allows me to scale back on freelance work to focus on my own projects. The goal is to be totally self-sufficient, and with every new Patron, I am one step closer. The entire d20Monkey archive and the upcoming IGS series is available online for free (and it always will be) but if you become one of my patrons, you will have access to all kinds of cool, Patreon-only content.  I consider myself very lucky to be in this position and I still have moments where it’s hard to believe that I get to draw my ridiculous comics and make things professionally. If you cannot support this page, all I ask is that you help spread the word to people who you think might enjoy my work.  Give me a follow over on Twitter  for a look at day-to-day life and  check out d20Monkey  and my  portfolio site .

Mastodon.ART  is a vibrant community of artists and creative folks on the decentralized and FOSS micro-blogging platform  Mastodon .\n It's been a home on the Fediverse for artists, writers, illustrators, \nmusicians, photographers, game developers, sculptors, knitters, \nmetalsmiths, ceramicists, performers, and more since Apr/2017. \nMastodon.ART will never sell your data, track you, serve you ads or \nsponsored posts, or mess with your chronological timelines, and it has  a robust Code of Conduct \n with clear rules defining what is and isn't allowed in the community, \nwhich is strictly enforced by its team of moderators. It is hosted on a \ndedicated server using  Masto.Host . Why Patreon? Mastodon.ART relies\n on the support of its users to pay for its operating costs. Running a \ncommunity like .ART isn't free– .ART will never run ads, sponsored \nposts, sell its users data, or track them– and is committed to providing\n a safe and supportive home on the web for artists of all kinds. \nHowever, there are still hosting and maintenance costs, and your support\n will ensure that this community remains free and open for many years to\n come. How will this money be used? Any funds\n collected from Patreon will go back into paying for and supporting the \nMastodon.ART community, primarily by paying its server/operating costs \nand the cost of the Mastodon.ART domain, but also through commissions \nand other forms of support for its users. Who am I? I am  @WelshPixie  / Delyth Angharad, a Welsh artist living in South Africa. I am  the current admin \n of Mastodon.ART, taking over from the previous curator  Rheall  in Feb/2021. I run .ART with the help of a fantastic team of dedicated \nmoderators. I started using Mastodon in around November 2016, and after a brief start on .social, made the permanent switch to .ART where I settled right in. Being part of such a creative community has been wonderful, and I am honored and humbled to be taking over ownership of the instance. What is Mastodon? Mastodon \n is a FOSS decentralized micro-blogging social media platform (similar \nto Twitter, but with many changes/updates/upgrades) which uses the \nActivityPub protocol to allow its users to connect with other services \nalso using ActivityPub. Its strength lies in  decentralization : \nallowing users to form their own servers (known as \"instances\") from \nwhich to host their own community on the platform, leading to a service \nmade up of thousands of instances all connected to each other. Each \ninstance has its own rules, giving people the power to manage and \nmaintain their own social communities which are able to communicate with\n each other and  the wider 'Fediverse' of services using the ActivityPub protocol ,\n such as Pleroma, PeerTube, Plume, Pixelfed, FunkWhale, Friendica, Write\n Freely, and more. Decentralization resists a large, centralized, often \ncapitalist authority controlling how people use and implement the \nservice and their data, and instead gives freedom and power to its users\n to control their content, data, and community. With content warnings, \nimage descriptions, a robust suite of moderation tools, and more, \nMastodon focuses on accessibility, privacy, and safety to empower its \nusers. Mastodon was created by @ Gargron / Eugen Rochko , but Mastodon.ART is not affiliated with him outside of being a supporter of the Mastodon platform. You can also support .ART on  Liberapay .

I want to tell you a bit about me and why I've set up this page.  My pastel journey began in 2011.  Burned out in naturopathic medical school and ready for a change of scenery, I left Seattle and moved to the town of Sebastopol in the San Fransisco Bay area.  Throughout my life art was a constant companion, whether I was actively drawing and painting, or just thinking about art, and all the amazing artwork  I would create \"when I finally had enough time.\"    I had decided in 2011, at age 27, that art was to become a priority in my life and not just a fantasy, or a dream I would eventually pursue.  That year I traveled throughout the west and southwest attending workshops with some of my favorite pastel artists.   Pastel painting became an obsession , and I'd spend 10-12 hours per day thinking about painting, watching videos, reading books, and ultimately attempting my hand at painting.  Many of those first pieces, probably the first 75-100, were utter failures.  They were cringe-worthy, but I had caught the painting bug, and  the subtle improvements I saw in my work were motivation to keep with it.   I heard the words of more experienced artists emphasizing that  time at the easel was the way to become a better artist.   After that year of total immersion, I finished my degree and picked painting back up in 2014.  Though life has become very full over the last several years (wife and kids, dog, house, medical career...the dream) I have always made painting a priority.   \n\t\tWith this commitment, I have had the good fortune to win several international awards including the Award of Excellence \n(2nd place overall) in the 2018 Pastel 100, 3rd place overall in the \n2017 Annual Plein Air Salon, and 1st place in the 2017 UART Pastel Paper\n Online Exhibition, and awards in the Pastel Society of America 2017 and 2018 annual exhibitions.  I've also been fortunate to be featured in articles in a number of \npublications, including Southwest Art, Plein Air Magazine, American Art \nCollector, and the Pastel Journal.  And recent exhibits in 2019 include a group museum show at the Brinton Museum in Wyoming and a two person show at Kathryn Turner Fine Art in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.   \n\t One thing I always wished I had when learning to paint in pastels was a  mentor, an instructor, somebody I could turn to when I felt stuck or needed support.  THAT is why I am starting this Patreon page.   In-person workshops are not always feasible, often fill up fast, and can be  expensive when you add up travel, hotel, food, and workshop fees.  Further, my focus is shifting from teaching in-person workshops to this virtual teaching format.  It's no longer sustainable for me to teach 10-12 workshops per year, help raise two young kids, and continue my medical practice.  So something had to give!  And quite honestly, I get frustrated with the weekend workshop format.  I get to spend 2-3 days with an artist, really get to know them, witness their artistic breakthroughs, and potentially never get to work with them again.    What I am offering through my page: My number one goal as a painting instructor has always been and will continue to be  helping you achieve your painting goals , whatever they may be.  Whether your goal is to be an internationally known pastelist, or an artist who paints for the sheer pleasure of producing something with your hands,  I want you to feel as fulfilled by your art as I have been over these past 9 years.   The graduated tiers I am offering run the gamut from video demonstrations to personal one-on-one mentoring.  "},

You'll be charged at every beginning of the month, so if you want to pledge and it's the end of the month, wait a little bit more if you don't want to be charged twice. I make Abdl Art and comics and hope to find time for game development. All characters here are portrayed as mature (18+) version of themselves. I want to come up with a good compromise between financial security and interesting rewards for you, that would allow me to continue projects in progress (like Perpetual Change) and offer new things (more Fan Art, Comics, and games once Perpetual Change is done.) ____________________ FAN ART \n\n The first of each month, I do a Fan Art post where you can suggest the character you'd like to see. After that, the first 50 suggestions of the post are made into two polls where you can vote for your favorites. Fan Art are usually cell-shaded pictures with backgrounds. The first two winners of each polls are getting drawn. Then I add one extra Fan Art of my choosing, no matter the amount of votes it gets. Expect 5 Fan Art a month. ____________________ COMICS \n\n There should be 4 comic pages a month : two pages of the ongoing comic serie, one page of collab with another artist and one page of a caption story.  If you want to download a comic in in its entirety, go to the top right arrow, next to the list of posts (Comics, Wip, Fan Art, etc.) and choose \"Archive\". You'll find all the comics and all the Fan Art packs. ____________________ GAME Every week, I do a report on the game I'm currently working on and every three months, you get a demo of the game! ____________________ SPECIAL LIVESTREAM The last working day of each month, I'll do a special livestream where Patreons can suggest anything they want. I'll be drawing the suggestions for 9 to 10 hours straight.  I'm doing work cycles of 5 months each. After a work cycle, I take a month to rest and prepare next projects.

But wait!  Do you guys like PSDs?   Too bad, I don't normally use multiple layers in finished artwork.  But, I can sometimes provide lineart, base colors, and finished renderings for art.  If you want to figure out how a painting process works, nothing beats a good educational video.  Sadly, your patroning won't get you any exclusive educational videos, because I don't like to discriminate against cheap people.  Education is for everyone.  Instead, you get to purchase  \"Sinix's burden of obligation\" .  A wonderful item which forces me to produce more quality content because of the incredible guilt I feel about taking money from people.  More streams?  Probably.  More videos?  Definitely.  More art? Of course. Thanks for reading.  Please shove your money in the money hole."},

Thank you for helping us make this happen. Please note: Sara's current medical situation has caused some delays, ontop of existing slower than normal COVID delays. It's just Mel right now - so please understand that when reaching out!  However, we're determined to continue doing monthly releases. Things will be delayed (sometimes way more than we'd like) but we will keep it going and update until it returns to normal.  With our start in 2020, we launched our Pin Club with two pin distinct lines.These pins will initially available at much lower costs through Patreon (in the month via pledges and then the Secret Shop). Once about 3 months pass, we'll add them to the general store after patrons have gotten what they wanted, at adjusted retail pricing!  These are released in a \"preorder\" style , which means it will take at minimum 4-6 months for pins to arrive, as we sample each pin and work to get exactly the right balance for each pin. Sometimes this can take  LONGER  if issues occur in manufacturing, as we push to getting pins as good as they can be. Please keep this in mind; we will always fulfill our pin promises, regardless of the time involved,  but there is patience involved .  We always will have some in-hands (though not necessarily standards) in the shop for patrons if you prefer to buy when they're ready. For being patient / helping with production, you get a steep discount for participating in the club (30%+).  Updates are always in Discord - please check there for routine progress!   Regardless, thank you for helping us make these visions come to life!

Hell-o Sinners! Thank you for taking the time to look at my Patreon page. I’m Eiynah, a Toronto based Ex-Muslim atheist (not the right-wing kind!)…. of Pakistani Background who grew up in Saudi Arabia (complicated backstory, I know).  What Do I do? I do variety of stuff, (If you’re on this page you may have heard of my show called  Polite Conversations ) mostly Podcasting  and illustration, but on occasion I blog, write articles and make children’s books too! My book  'My Chacha (uncle) is Gay'  has been used in libraries and schools across the Toronto area.  I also enjoy talking about atheist-y stuff, my atheism is informed by my progressive values, unlike much of the current online atheist movement unfortunately.  My work has been featured on Buzzfeed, VICE magazine, ELLE magazine, Huffington Post and many more publications. I promise, I'm not *that* bad at what I do.  My Journey I started off as a blogger writing specifically about the topic of Pakistani sexuality (that’s where the name ’Nice Mangos’ comes from) but now my work has expanded to include much more.  I became interested in discussing atheism & secularism and sort of fell into the New Atheist scene for a while (I know I know! Embarrassing :/ - but I guess leaving a harsh theocracy can make you vulnerable to that for a while). For what it’s worth, I’ve left all that behind and am quite a vocal critic of the issues in the online atheist scene now, which doesn’t win me any friends in high places >___< Being a left leaning ex-muslim in this increasingly far right, anti-muslim climate is pretty rough. I feel that the ex muslim movement has shifted from having the noble goal of simply de-stigmatizing apostasy, to feeding the anti-islam/anti-muslim rightwing outrage machine... Where many prominent figures within the movement will ally with anyone giving them a platform to criticize Islam, be it Breitbart or Rebel Media. This is not something I would like to be a part of, so if you follow the online atheist scene, you'll notice I've distanced myself from that whole thing.    My Concerns and Areas of Focus As someone who grew up in Saudi Arabia, it's awful to see the western, more ‘polished' apologetics of extreme conservatism in the form of pseudo intellectuals like the 'Intellectual Dark Web'. I see familiar themes coming from that murky corner of the internet, themes I thought I left behind with the extreme Salafist mullahs in Saudi. Things like 'Can men and women really work together?', 'Are women simply not suitable for certain high paying jobs?', ‘A woman's natural role is to have babies’, ‘MeToo/feminism has gone too far’, etc. --This is the kind of thing I find alarming these days, and focus on tackling that in my work. Ironically, I've seen too many fellow ex muslims claim they're rejecting religion for containing bigoted views, only to find the same thing and embrace it in the form of western conservative public figures.  My goal for my podcast is to have interesting long-form conversations on a variety of topics, sometimes with people of opposing views, but that does not mean 'softballing' or even constantly manufacturing combative conversations for clicks.  How you Help If you enjoy my work, you can help support it through Patreon. Your support helps me allocate more time and resources into researching and producing a better quality podcast, more illustrations and longer term projects like children’s books. You can also help support the work by sharing it with friends and family you think might find it interesting, and by vocally supporting and sharing it on social media. :)  I'm a freelance graphic designer by day, so I have no 9-5 day job to fall back on, freelancing means a constant hustle to make a steady income. - your support makes a huge difference in my ability to continue podcasting! I am truly grateful to have people who support the creative work I do.  What you get If you sign up today, there are perks in it for you!

Ph.D. candidates, history educators, fantasy authors, fans of historical media and cultural studies, as well as those who are just interested in learning something different have found new and exciting information at Medievalpoc. These artworks and documentation are readily available on multiple social media platforms, including  Tumblr ,  Facebook ,  Twitter , and  Medievalpoc.org . The goal of Medievalpoc is not to  hoard  information, but to share it as widely as possible and incite discussion in social as well as activist and educational communities.  The traditional relationship between creators and their patrons have long been a part of human history. With the advent of social media, the opportunity to not only share these creations with a massive audience, but to actively engage with and become a  part  of the creative process, is both unprecedented and old as humankind. Patronage will provide the opportunity to not only bring Medievalpoc to a wider audience online, but the ability to travel for appearances at academic and literary conventions, speak at functions, and facilitate activist work in face-to-face environments. Patronage means more access to databases, art collections, and academic resources for the creation of Medievalpoc. In addition, your patronage can pave the way for exciting new projects across various media, like print, film, and interactive online content--projects Patrons can see in the making. Patrons of Medievalpoc will have a unique access to the creation of Medievalpoc, the research and writing process, as well as interviews, discussions, theory writing, rough drafts and brainstorming. Patrons can give feedback on projects as they happen. Creator Goals will be added and enhanced as new projects take shape and become realized through the unique processes that shape discussions at Medievalpoc. With patronage, Medievalpoc will be better able to expand its platforms and run more smoothly across social media sites, with improved synchronization and accessibility.  I look forward to forging a new era of Patron and Creator with my readers in my goal of bringing Art and History to life in a new way-a History in which we can see ourselves."},

So, I'm Elaine (or TriaElf9 online) and I'm a comic artist living in Japan. I've been doing web comics since 2005, and through my love of creating, I decided that I wanted this to be my job! My works My main comic is a queer high fantasy comic,  Pathways: Chronicles of Tuvana.  I also make a loyal adaptation of the Peter Pan novel,  Princess Retribution ( which has been revamped and published through Scout Comics as  Princess Revolution), Wayfarer of Vyrandel,  and  Bellanaris  a Dragon Age fan comic. This Patreon also supports my autobiographical comic about living in Japan,  Aichi Adventures . On the side, I do gag strips, illustrations, and other fun things. I also dabble in fanart, which varies depending on what things I like, so you will see those comics and illustrations posted here as well. My works can be found on a few sites: Pathways  here  and on  Deviant Art , Peter Pan is  here  and on  Deviant Art , and Bellanaris can be read  here .

I am currently most active on Twitter. How Patreon figures in All of my comics are offered online for free, and that's not going to change. However, most of my time is spent doing comics, and like most living beings, I need to eat, pay for healthcare and the like, and feed my cats, my wife and our baby ^_- The more that comes from the Patreon, the less time I spend doing side jobs and the more time I can devote to comics for you all to enjoy! How does Patreon work? For those of you who are new to Patreon, it's a pretty cool system! As a patron of my comics, you'll pay monthly. This means, if you choose the $3 dollar reward, for example, you will only pay 3 dollars a month. Plus, you'll get the perks that come with that level! You can also set a limit on how much you want to pay, which makes sure you don't go over budget for the month/year, which is especially important if you're pledging to multiple Patreons. Perks To thank you for all your support, there are some pretty awesome perks for patrons! There are some monthly perks like wallpapers, a chibi, a monthly WIP, and exclusive access to any tutorials I do, as well as the tutorial archive. And each level has a few other perks on top of those bonuses! See below for some examples ^_^ Wallpapers (for all patrons!): Weekly Wips: Early Art: Early Comics: How to Comics Participant: Adventure Archive: And so much more! ^_^"},

I have been living in Japan for almost 10 years and I'm trying to capture its beauty in my works. I have been working as a full-time background artist for animated TV series (for example \"Space Dandy\") and movies (like \"Your Name.\") but decided to focus on my own art and start a freelance artist career in 2017. Since then I directed short animations, did paintings, comics, and art-related videos but most importantly published watercolor art books like the \"Tokyo Storefronts\" and “Tokyo at Night”. The main goal of this Patreon campaign is to maximize the amount of time I can spend on my personal art projects that I can share with you! Also, I want to show you how I make my art so you can learn and hopefully get some inspiration from my process. I want to use Patreon to directly answer questions you might have about me or my art. With the time I get thanks to your donations here, I plan to make more illustrations (painted by hand with watercolors, gouache, etc. and sometimes digitally) comics (available for you online and in printed form) books, zines, and prints of my art videos showing you my art-making process, tutorials, and video lessons much more other stuff! and then share it all with you! I want to keep my content available for all my followers  so I don't have much to offer here, but If you decide to become my supporter you get following rewards depending on your pledge amount (tier descriptions are in the right-hand column):  Access to my paid videos and other paid content, current and the ones I'm planning to make.

My name is Ben Komets and I am a professional miniature artist based in Berlin, Germany. You may know me from video tutorials I have done for Paintingbuddha, companies like Miniature Mentor, or from one of the many classes I have taught in different countries. Since starting two decades ago, I have laboured at my craft of painting miniatures and have won awards in dozens of painting competitions all over the world. Three years ago, I decided to go into miniature painting as a full time profession, painting box art miniatures for several miniature companies and private commission pieces at my home studio in Berlin. Now, I am pleased to announce that I will start to release my own small range of miniatures, working with world class sculptors to cater to all painters.   WHY PATREON? I would like to show you how I work and what motivates me to push the boundaries of miniature art. I know that a lot of people follow my work in progress on Facebook daily as a source of inspiration, or study my techniques to become better painters. Even with the tutorials that have already been published, there is so much more to show you. Patreon is a great platform that allows me to produce the best material for you to improve your painting level based on your feedback, allowing me to invest more time in teaching and talking about miniatures. WHAT DO YOU GET? Your patronage gives you access to exclusive, detailed work in progress pictures and beautifully designed color guides for every model I paint, regular in-depth tutorials and video tutorials paired with Q&A sessions so you can engage with the entire process, start to finish with easy-to-follow and comprehensive teaching material; drawing on two decades of knowledge and passion so that you can get your painting skills to the next level. And, in case you should need a little more guidance or personal feedback, there's also pledge level for that! Example PDF FUTURE PLANS As I'm still working on the technical set up here in the studio, to begin with I can guarantee one video OR detailed tutorial per month, forming the foundation of the course. I hope that with some additional funding from aspiring miniature artists out there we can increase the frequency of production, as it takes a lot of time to put together."},

I understand that not everyone is in a position to financially support the artists they love... if that's the case, no sweat. I still really appreciate your support in every other way. Whether that's you spreading the word, sharing a link, or even just blasting poetry at a stop sign through your open car window (which is so literary gangster by the way)... it all helps and is very much appreciated. I'm guessing that a lot of you know me because of other work I've done, To This Day, Troll, Heaven or Whatever, Shoulders, and the like. I get asked a lot to make more videos or record more pieces or re-record pieces to make them classroom friendly. Believe me when I tell you that there's almost nothing else I want to be doing, but you guessed it... it's costly. I work with a lot of amazing people and am always trying to expand my collaborative horizons, but we're all limited in how much of our time we can donate. As much as I'd like to be paid for what I do I would also really like to pay the people who help me do it. Yes, I write the poems, but there's a lot of other magic that goes into the videos, music, and illustrations. When I say magic I mean really hard work done by monstrously talented individuals whom I love. So why should you pledge? So we can keep doing it. There's a ton of projects I'd like to get off from the drafting board and into actual production, but i need your help to do it.  Here's a short list of things I'd like to do with your support: Podcast Videos Audio Recordings Short Films Web Series Graphic Novel Children's Book Feature Film Documentary Animations Illustrated Poems I think the \"per thing\" method makes more sense than the monthly path. Some projects will just take longer than others so it will help keep the pressure off and insure the quality of each creation. Sometimes you can end up cutting corners if you're trying to reach a deadline... this just makes sure that I won't have to do that. I thank you again for any and all of your support in its many forms. Now let's make art. Yours,        Shane"},

I invite you to join and contribute to a circle of creativity, devotion and service. All patrons will be granted access to the entire content \nshared here, regardless of the level of sponsorship. I look forward to offering behind-the-scenes viewing of work in progress, special classes and workshops, online soundbath sessions and more... About Me I grew up at Bhaktivedanta Manor, a temple and spiritual community in England, founded on the teachings of bhakti-yoga. In my early years I attended the small temple school, in which we learned sacred mantras and teachings alongside our regular subjects.  From a very young age, I loved to draw and write and had the fortune to study classical music and dance (Eastern and Western) throughout my youth. All of these arts were nurtured in the environment of the temple, where especially music and chanting, played a vital role in daily life. I learned that the highest expression of art is to offer it in the service and glory of the Supreme.  After graduating from university in 2009, I faced a crossroads. I knew my heart felt called to become further immersed in the devotional arts, but I was very unsure and afraid of what that meant. A fateful meeting with sacred musicians, Gaura Vani, and The Mayapuris gave me the confidence to take a leap of faith, and travel around the world for the next two years supporting the sharing kirtan of everywhere from concert halls to psychiatric hospitals.  For twelve years now I have been blessed with the opportunity to serve \nthrough my artistic offerings. It's a calling that I wish to pursue in \nwhatever way possible for the rest of my life.  I believe that \nnow, more than ever, the world needs the healing, purifying vibration of\n the Divine names, and all kinds of art inspired by devotion. What is patronage? In the history of art, patronage refers to the encouragement or financial support that an organization or individual bestows to another. In centuries gone by, artists of all kinds were dependent on patronage to be able to focus on their creative work. In our modern day, the platform Patreon offers an amazing opportunity to become a part of the life and work of artists that you love.  As I continue to create and share, whether it be recording new music, facilitating experiences with kirtan and healing sound, creating visual art and more, I want to invite you to become co-creators. Please join me on the quest to bring more love and devotion to this world.  Thank you! I deeply value the culture of giving according to one's means as an act of generosity. This is the traditional system for sharing of knowledge and art in ancient times, and I believe it is just as relevant today. Therefore all patrons will be granted access to the entire content \nshared here, regardless of the level of sponsorship.  I am very grateful for whatever support you choose to offer!  In service,  Jahnavi"},

Supporting my Patreon helps support me during this new stage of my life, at a time when I am unable to work like I used to. It also allows me to help raise awareness for my condition,  and build resources for since a lmost everyone either knows someone in pain, or is experiencing it themselves. Through the thoughtful questions of my Patrons that I answer via video, and my own articles sharing what I've learned in navigating my disabilities and making my living space more accessible, I hope to help people understand pain—and how to cope with it— better. Where It Began: From Lawyer to Travel and Food Writer My business started out as a website, Legal Nomads, built in 2008 just before I set out on what I thought would be a one year trip around the world. It was meant to be a fun space to share my misadventures with family and friends during a sabbatical from the law. That one year turned into several, and the blog organically turned into a creative and professional journey. It was beyond exciting to build something that allowed me to learn as much as possible every day, and share a view of the world that hopefully helped others to grow with me. As I floated further and further away from my legal background, it was also a time of entrepreneurial uncertainty I love writing, and that's part of what helped me take the leap. I would continue to write even if no one was reading. But thankfully, people  did  read. Over time, Legal Nomads flourished and was featured in newspapers and magazines, and I moved into public speaking about community-building and the neuroscience of storytelling.  For over a decade, I travelled around the world full time, guided by insatiable curiosity and my appetite. I researched eating as a celiac in Portugal, Thailand, Japan, and elsewhere, building gluten free guides for those who wanted to follow in my footsteps, and detailed celiac translation cards in a dozen languages. I spent quite a few of those years in Vietnam, and the latter part of the decade in Oaxaca, Mexico — both to learn, share, and hopefully help readers navigate the world differently through food, even with celiac disease. I kept the site ad-free and without pop-ups or sponsored text links, focusing income instead on products I built that readers asked for, like a book about food, hand-drawn maps of (you know it…) food, and guides to some of my favourite places to eat in and visit. Patreon: A Means to Support, and to Educate Initially, my community asked me to set up a Patreon to help support me during this very difficult time where I couldn't work like I used to. Over time, it's become a place to share thoughts and resources to help people better understand chronic pain. This includes how to discuss pain with someone you care about, ways to help, and the nitty gritty of adjusting to a very different life. With your support, I hope keep at communicating, sharing, teaching, and learning to the extent I can. With limited capacity for output these days, being able to continue creating is a huge percentage of what keeps me afloat mentally. Becoming a Patreon will directly contribute to: Funding my operating costs so that I can keep my websites, mailing lists, and projects afloat, including a sound engineer to help edit videos and audio, artists I hire to create illustrations to accompany my writing, and more. Supporting me so I can write more pieces on Legal Nomads about the journey from these last years.  Supporting me so I can volunteer with organizations that help raise awareness for my rare conditions. Supporting articles about tips and strategies to learn how to cope when in grief, or when life goes very differently than you had planned. Helping me convert my blog posts about chronic illness into audio form in order to make them more accessible to others (I will work with a sound engineer to do this) General support as I navigate this new, limited, way of life. What about you? Given my limitations, I made this a support-only Patreon. I’ve offered three tiers of general support with the same level of access and benefits. I don’t want to promise something I can’t deliver to you, so I’d rather give full access and add tiers if my health allows. Here's what you can expect with your tier pledge: Your name on the  Patreon thank you page  on Legal Nomads. Early access to Legal Nomads news before anyone else gets it.  Ability to vote on future episode topics for my podcast, once it is launched. Submitting questions for a monthly video or audio AMA. Access to videos about chronic pain, travel, meditation, coping with uncertainty, and more.  Supporting me with a stable income at a time where I’m physically unable to work as I used to. A thank you hand-drawn image of your tier bird, one of Bob, Fiona, or Arthur. Currently Disabled: A CSF Leak and Other Chronic Conditions I wanted to share a bit more about my prognosis, for those who may be interested in understanding it better. In 2017, a spinal tap led to a  cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak , which causes me incredible pain when I am standing up. I am left with very little ‘uptime’, the standing time required to live my days. CSF is a liquid that bathes and supports the brain and spinal cord, protected by a membrane that keeps the CSF where it’s supposed to be. When there is a hole in that membrane, the CSF seeps out – a CSF leak.  What does this CSF leak in my spine do? For starters, it means that every time I stand, the low CSF volume causes my brain to painfully ‘sag’. It also leads to other symptoms like dizziness, nausea, nerve pain, blurred vision, and impaired balance.  I went from building a business I loved while traveling the world, to spending 23 hours of my day in bed.  The fix for a spinal CSF leak is a blood patch, where they inject blood into your epidural space and it seals the leak site. For some, surgery. Some people have chronic CSF leaks where the procedures do not stick for a variety of reasons. I am one of those people. I had four procedures, but I am still leaking. I have not yet returned for a fifth procedure due to other complications, which sadly make the treatment even more risky for me. These complications include nerve damage in my spine, a connective tissue disorder called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (I wrote about it  here ), and an immune condition called  Mast Cell Activation Disorder  that has required me to limit my life even further, including the foods that I can consume. So not only can I not stand much, or work much, but I’m also very limited in what I can eat. All this to say: I may be the worst food and travel writer ever? Jokes aside, my day to day is a remarkably sharp contrast to what it was. As you can imagine, it’s a stark difference, and has required a lot of effort during the last few years just to accept and adjust my mindset to the limitations of my present. Still, I am here today, knowing that human connection is part of what sees us through. And although my physical mobility may now be severely limited, the curiosity that led to a life of travel and exploration around the world is still here. It guides me now on an inward journey, one that has already connected me to you, my community, in new and deeper ways. It also fuels my desire to keep researching innovative ways to approach pain with my conditions, and with your help, to keep sharing those findings with the world.  ___ Many of you have asked how you can help support me since the spinal CSF leak changed my life. If you’ve enjoyed my soup recommendations, my years of ad-free writing on Legal Nomads, or want to help as my business shifts form during this new stage in my life, my Patreon is the best way to provide support. I would be honoured for you to join this wonderful community. If you're a new reader or found this page via my writing about chronic pain, I hope this community helps support you and provide strategies that make life a little bit easier. With your help, I hope to continue sharing the work you love, that hopefully helps you feel less alone. xo, Jodi"},

Other stuff I've made includes games like  Depression Quest  or  Waiting For Godot: The Game . Sometimes it’s tools to help people make their own games like  Sortingh.at  or  GamesAreForEveryone.com . Sometimes I run game jams and community projects like  Antholojam . Sometimes it’s crisis hotlines that involve  stopping SWATings  and  advocating to Congress  for an open but safer web like with  Crash Override Network . Sometimes it’s writing pieces  on cybernetics , developing   artisanal tamagotchis ,  or making free chrome extensions like  the Ferenginizer .  There’s a lot more, but you get the point. Thing is, this is a very hard thing to monetize. What do you do when you make things that need to be free? There’s too many things in too many directions to attempt to crowdfund each and every one of them, so rather than be project-specific, this Patreon is my central hub for being able to continue doing things like this. Why Should You Back Me? I make a whole lot of free stuff, which can get rather expensive. This is especially true for games like the FMV Chuck Tingle dating sim. Supporting me on Patreon not only allows me to keep doing this stuff, but lets me keep it free while giving backers exclusive access to project updates, alpha tests, and all kinds of cool stuff. So, if you believe in that work too, and you like what I’ve made so far, please consider supporting my efforts on here, or making a one-time contribution  here . Thanks so much!"},

The second one ( The Carp-Faced Boy and Other Tales ) was a finalist for The Bram Stoker Award (2017). I'm a Clarion West ('15) graduate, Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley Scholarship recipient, and a podcaster at  Uncanny Japan . What I want to do is introduce you to parts of Japan your probably don't know about. I want to show you all the cool, weird, creepy stuff, the uncanny. This is me: I'm an American expat writer who has spent half my life in a small Japanese fishing town. And by 'small fishing town' I mean a place where every day it feels like I'm stepping back in time. This is old Japan where the line that divides myth from reality isn't just blurred it's nonexistent. Superstitions and legends have been passed down for generations, and they continue to affect daily life. This is a culture where I had to change the floor plans to my house because the kitchen door was sitting in a northeast direction – also known as the  Kimon  or Devil's Gate – and would surely invite rancid luck into my home. It's a society where one day, apropos of nothing, my mother-in-law declared me \"sticky\" and insisted I have an exorcism because I attract ghosts. This coexistence of ancient and modern has fascinated me for the past twenty six years, and I’ve used my fluency in the language to study the parts of Japan which have yet to be revealed to Western audiences. I’m a professional  writer * who adores this mythic world – one that has informed my stories for years – and am sitting on a treasure trove of untranslated information. Using this Patreon, I want to bring these gems to you in three ways: 1 –  Podcast My biweekly podcast –  Uncanny Japan  – is where I share these odd bits of research. What makes my podcast different is that I record them while wearing binaural mics. This means that as I sit by the shore, hike through the mountains, or even watch a local festival, you'll be with me, learning about Japan, and experiencing the soundscapes exactly as I do.  2 – Art I adore making postcard-sized pictures depicting all the strange creatures and beautiful characters of Japan. These days I do  hanga  carvings, brush and inks, or Japanese  etegami -watercolors. These will be available in the Rewards section. Below are a few of my creations.         \n\n3 –  Writing \n Dearest to my heart is the writing: my short stories and novels. Here is where I combine all of my research with my\n26-years of living in Japan and weave you a tale. (See below for my already published and soon-to-be-published works).  \n Your pledges through Patreon\nand engagement as readers and listeners will provide me the support to pursue my passion for creating art: recording  my podcasts , painting freaky postcards, and\nwriting dark, uncanny stories and novels.  \n \n\nYou\nhelp  me , and I promise to use these three mediums to introduce you to all the weird secrets lurking in the nooks and\ncrannies of Japan. \n \n\nThank you, \n \n\nThersa *    2017  Finalist for The Bram Stoker Award short story collection : The Carp-Faced Boy and Other Tales *    Graduate of  Clarion West (2015) .  *    Recipient of  HWA's Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley Scholarship.   *    Author of  A Robe of Feathers and Other Stories  (Counterpoint LLC, 2009).  *    My second collection – The Carp-Faced Boy and Other Tales – (Independent Legions Press,   February 2017). *    I've also had stories\npublished in various magazines and anthologies ( Black Static , The Fortean Times,  The Madhouse Anthology  and  The Beauty of Death Anthology  to name a few.) *     My retelling of the Japanese horror tale, \"The Wife Who Didn't Eat\" appears in the  A World of Horror Anthology .  *     My serialized story \"Sara and the In-Between\", ran in Asahi Weekly from July through September. The audio version is available as a 3-part Bedtime Story on Patreon for $5.00 and up Patrons.  ※I'm using the charge up front method, where new Patrons will be charged when they join and then at the beginning of each month. I'm guessing this means if you want to become a Patron later in the month, it might be a good idea to wait until the first of the next month so you won't get charged in quick succession.

You could call it “nerdy with a\ndark twist,” or as a clever admirer once put it: “Disney after dark!” \n\n(This is a tag line I absolutely would have\nstolen, if I weren’t worried about misinterpretation by concerned mothers).  \n\nReally what I make are original\nillustrations, twisted fan art & dark humor greeting cards at home with my\nGoblins in the Pacific Northwest! \n\nWhat I love most about what I do, are the\nhappy responses from people who think I did justice to a character they love, any\nand all giggles for my weird greeting cards, and a shared connection with tons\nof people I’ve never met, who seem to love all the same things as I do.  That is also why I love telling stories and\nhiding secrets in my pieces, just for you to find, like a sneaky secret we can\nshare. \n\nFreelance illustrating for me means I spend\n90% of my time working alone (well, the goblins are there, but they aren’t much\nhelp), but the joyful reactions and requests I get from folks that love what I’m\ndoing make me feel quite the opposite! \n\nAnd, SEGWAY ALERT, this is why I’ve started\nthis Patreon page! \n\nI’ve had an amazing first year of freelancing;\nI feel like I have the support of the most awesome fan base there is, and I\nwant to use more of my time making the things you guys have been asking for! In\nfact, there are SO many things on my illustrations to-do list that I think it\nwould take 2 years to get it all done, and it’s only growing!  \n\nOn the other hand, to pay the bills (goblins\nare expensive eaters) I’ve taken on more and more commissions, which I’m BEYOND\ngrateful for, but the downside is that I have no time left for my own\ncreations. As a result, I get lots of “when is that Jack Skellington piece\ncoming out?? And all I can say is “I WANT to do it NOW! But I can’t! Because commissions\nare keeping the goblins fed! And you won’t like them when they’re hungry!” \n\nSo here we are! This patreon page is my best\nstab at creating a space for all of us nerds with a dark side, where a manageable\namount of your hard earned money can help me feed those goblins, make some new\nthings, AND give some of those creations straight to you! \n\nIn fact, if you browse through the tiers here,\nyou’ll find that I’ll be creating special things EXCLUSIVELY for you each\nmonth! I’ll also be sharing the methods behind the madness and behind the\nscenes stuff that no one else gets to see, and giving you the greatest say in\nwhat I make next! \n\nI really truly hope you’ll become a patron & join me on this\nstrange and unusual journey to make art and purchase goblin food! But if not, you\nstill have my undying gratitude for making it to the end of this \"about\" page! \n\nEither way, I hope you’ll keep tabs on me at\nany of these sites, and stay spooky! \n\nWebsite:  DreaDIllustrations.com \n\nInstagram:  @Drea.D.Art \n\nEtsy:  https://www.etsy.com/shop/DreaDIllustrations \n\nfacebook:  @DreaD.Illustration \n\n \n\nDreaDfully yours,  \n\nDrea D. A HUGE THANK YOU and heartfelt welcome to you, my dear Bogey!! I am so very grateful to have your support on this strange and unusual journey to make art and purchase goblin food!! My Goblins are the most important thing in the world to me, so I designed this page specifically to give you more of what you like! I very much hope to hear your input, requests, and anything at all you’d like to share with me, or the Goblin community at large! Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you ever need anything at all or have any questions, I’m SO excited to have you here AND you can now sleep soundly at night knowing you’re immune to any Goblin’s curse!

Full Page Artwork: (example of full-page artwork) This is how it works: Every month I will put up some ideas like this: Patrons  then get to  vote  on whichever one they prefer, in this case number 2 won the vote. I then create a new post  and we all have a  discussion  about the details of the image. After the discussion I create a  thumbnail sketch  based on all the feedback. Then I draw up a  pencil sketch , while still sticking to the general layout of the thumbnail: After this stage I will ask everyone if there are any other small things they think should be added, then move onto the final colour, here's a  closer look at some details   (I did a version with and without rain): Bespoke Fillers: As well as the main piece I also create  colour fillers  (plus card art version)  and  line-art fillers  for  bespoke filler tiers  to  their specifications  (I have very limited numbers of these, but will hopefully be opening up more). Here are some examples of the kinds of pieces created. Colour fillers: Line-art fillers: Credit Rewards: Patrons get  credits  added to their account every month which they can exchange for\nanything on my  DriveThruRPG store . These can be used at any time or saved up. \n\n To use credits , patrons can  message me on Patreon  with\nwhat they would like, and I send out  complimentary copies via DriveThruRPG  and deduct the\ncredits accordingly. \n\n \n\n The cost of stock art is as follows: \n\n Book Cover Template  - 1 Credit B/W Line-Art Filler  - 1 Credit Colour Filler - 2 Credits Quarter Page  - 3 Credits Character -   Colour & B/W line-Art - 4 Credits Half Page - 5 Credits Colour Filler - 7 Credits You can also spend  credits  on having  alterations  done to my  previous stock-art . Alterations: Small/Minor alterations such as skin colour, item change/remove etc message me whenever you would like one of these changes and I will normally be able to do them within a few days. Black and White Filler  – 50 to 75 Credits Colour Filler  – 50 to 100 Credits Cover  – 50 to 150 Credits (Larger/Major changes may be possible and if you need one let me know and I will give you a credit quote for it) Bespoke Fillers: These will only be available as and when I put up a post to say I have time for one, they will not be available every month, when one is available all those who have enough credits will be welcome to put their name down and I will draw a winner who will then get to use their credits to get a free bespoke filler!

For the past five years I’ve created audio adaptations of articles\nfrom the SCP wiki (\n http://www.scp-wiki.net/ ),\na horror based community writing site that has risen in popularity in recent\ntimes. As time has went on, I’ve put more and more effort into trying to make\nmy content look and sound to the highest quality I can personally make it.  \nIt’s been a personal goal of mine (since I can remember) to make it as a voice\nactor, and my YouTube and small following has allowed me (in a very basic way)\nto do this. I have been featured multiple times in an SCP themed PC game called\n“SCP: Containment Breach” – in this game I voice several characters (\n https://scpcb.gamepedia.com/Voice_Actors )\nbut the one I am most known for is the mysterious Plague Doctor “SCP-049”.  \n Ok, the main reason i'm starting Patreon as a means of support (apart from people asking) is that I want to make better content for my listeners - because the more financial support I receive, I can take more requests, vastly improve the quality of my work and create artwork to accompany my videos (i've been learning Blender for a year now in an effort to create photo realistic images that enhance the realism/immersion of my work) ... all of this means better content that you will enjoy! Not to mention (OK, i'll mention it) the rewards you will get exclusively from Patreon, so this can only be a positive step forward. Over the past year – I have been gradually stepping up\nmy production ambition for videos and as I have done this I have become aware\nthat due to the horror nature of my videos, they are being deemed inappropriate\nby certain ad companies (even though to my knowledge I have made my content adhere\nto their advertising guidelines), this makes it much harder for me to continue\nmaking content with certain themes.\n \nThat being said – I know there is still an audience for what\nI do!. So I have decided to open a means of support for people that appreciate\nwhat I do. I have set up a number of rewards for people that might like to\nsupport me (and who knows, if this is successful … it might end up making the\nchannel even better!).  Thank you for reading and I hope you choose to support me - i'm 99% certain you won't regret it. -Aaron \"TheVolgun\" McKee \n \n"},

My vision is for everyone to have a creative practice in their life. Whether you are a complete beginner or a seasoned mark-maker, we are all truly beginners on this path. I consider beginner's mind one of the most important things about how we go about our creative work. I especially love to encourage those who say, \"I don't have a creative bone in my body! I can't do art!\" Well, I'm here to tell you...yes you DO, and yes you CAN!  Dandelion Lessons will be a big part of what we share here. They bring two-fold joy: first to us while in the act of creation, and then to someone else as we share our creation with others. Watch the introductory video to learn more about Dandelion Lessons. But we will also be learning real techniques for those who want to bring more presence to their art works, more realism. I have taught my unique approach to over 50,000 students and counting, world-wide. I really hope you will join me. And thank you, so much, for being here. NOTE TO MY NEW PATRONS: I am sharing things in a linear approach here, building on skills, step by step, for a strong foundation.

My name is Kat. Some of you may know me from The Voice. Some of you may know me from my fabulous San Francisco/Seattle/LA variety show, Misfit Cabaret. Some of you may know me from seeing me trek up and down the east coast in my very first band, The Design. Or maybe you just stumbled upon this page and are intrigued. HELLO! I have a Patreon.  Why?  I want to release new art to you (songs, music videos, and other artistic endeavors) without you having to wait. I plan on releasing a thing every 3-4 months, and I'll always give Patreon backers a heads up! Misfit Cabaret  is a wild variety rock opera for which I write two new original songs for every new show. Each show is themed, and I write within the parameters of the theme. For instance- we have a cult film variety show called Cinephilia, so I wrote songs about  Edward Scissorhands  and  photo journalists turning war into art . For Whimsea, our nautical themed show, I wrote a song about a real life  underwater ballroom tragedy , and a song about  David Bowie on a beach  (he had just passed away, I wanted/needed to write a song for him, and parameters have workarounds). For A Very Bloody Misfit Cabaret, I wrote a song about Stephen King's Carrie White and a song about  alcohol in the form of a succubus .  For the first 10 songs from Misfit Cabaret, I released a heavy full length album through Kickstarter ( CHECK IT OUT! ).  Now that we're doing a brand new  Misfit Cabaret  every two months, the music is flowing fast, and rather than wait an entire year or two to release all of the new songs on another album and do yet another giant KS campaign, I would love to record them one at a time and give them to you as soon as they are ready to be released. Patreon is perfect for this. The first song I released through Patreon was  \"What An Excellent Day For An Exorcism\" , along with \"King\" and  \"Criminal\" .  In addition to releasing new music, I also want to create cinematic music videos for some (or all) of the Misfit Cabaret studio recordings. Incredible videographers in the Bay Area have approached me with ideas that I'm over the moon for, and I would love to create visual art to go along with each of these songs. Since the launch of my Patreon, we have funded and released a music video for \"Artists\", \"Song For David Bowie\", \"Criminal\", \"King\" and \"What An Excellent Day For An Exorcism\".  In supporting this Patreon, you are not only supporting me as an artist, you are also supporting the Bay Area artist community. Having the funds to record new songs and create new videos means I get to employ local artists– just as Misfit Cabaret employs local performers and gives them a big gorgeous stage to dazzle on.  Thank you for your support! Now let's go make some art together! xo, Kat Banner photo by  Gina Barbara Photography Cover photo by  Gina Barbara Photography   Live footage by Andy Strong, Mark Semegen, and Lish Lash Live photos by Patric Carver ***FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS: 1. How much will this cost me?  Is it a monthly charge? ANSWER: There are two ways of setting a Patreon up- one is a monthly cost and one is a pay-per-thing. I went with the pay per thing option because I'm only going to be putting something out once every 3-5 months. I wouldn't want people to pay monthly if they're not receiving anything. It's completely up to you how much you pay for a thing. There are different price tiers to the right of the page, and you can be a patron for as little as $1 and receive song downloads and other goodies."},

Where I share all of my art and how I make it! The majority of the sketches I create do not make it to social media. Mainly because it's very personal and I frequently get sucked into the process of creating. Patreon is a place for me to share the art journey as it unfolds. Through Patreon, you can become an active supporter of my art and take a peek behind the curtain of how the magic happens.  Via Patreon Lens - I chat a lot about my thought process in the moment of creating a painting.  I share a plethora of my knowledge I've accumulated as an independent artist and from my time at Ringling College of Art and Design as an Illustration student. Along with Lens,  I document the development of my paintings in the Sketchbook PDF.   You'll find scans of the initial rough sketch, the tight sketch right before painting, and many scans showcasing the multiple layers of my watercolor process. The Sketchbook PDF also includes my practice studies and prep work for my final illustrations. On top of that, you also get  access to a VIP Discord channel  where we all chat and hangout. Its seriously AMAZING!!! Since its exclusive to Patrons Only, it's a close knit community. Need feedback on your artwork or recommendations on art supplies, ask on the Patron Discord! It's also where I hang out and chat with Patrons. Things to know! Payments are charged as soon as you pledge, then renew at the beginning of the following month on the 1st.  Physical rewards are mailed once the month is over so I have an accurate count on the Limited Edition Postcards. For example December Postcard will be mailed in January, usually around the 15th. You can cancel or change your pledge at any time. For example, one month you might feel adventurous and want the Sketchbook PDF, go for it! You will be charged the difference upon upgrading. Thank you so much for your support! I greatly appreciate it! FAQ When will you return to YouTube? Once I complete all catch up Patreon rewards and comfortable on schedule with production, I will dip my toes back into the work of video creation :D When will your Store reopen? TBD!   Like YouTube, once I complete Patreon catch up, I will work on reopening shop again. I have piles of artwork to put in the shop, yay! My postcard arrived damaged!? What do?? Oh nooooo!! Message me here on Patreon and I'll be more than happy to mail a replacement. Please provide your current mailing address to expedite the replacement process :D"},

The human figure is at the heart of our work. We come from different countries, cultures and education, and we are all at different stages of our careers. Some of us are students. Others are taking their first steps towards building careers as practicing artists. Some are already there. Our journeys all started at our studios in Florence, Sweden, or New York. Each of these amazing spaces nurtured our individual visions and gave us the skills to reach our full artistic potential.   We have created a symbiotic platform between artists and patrons to give you access to our techniques, our process and to the amazing new works we are creating. All the artists in  The   Florence Academy of Art Collective  have donated their time to share with you what is happening within this vibrant community. For a very small amount per month, you get behind the scenes of The Florence Academy of Art, interact with some of our artists, and see their work in creation.

Did you love to color as a kid?   Are you a part of the coloring book trend that has swept the world in recent years?  Then you already have a head start!  Most people have used colored pencils at some point in their lives which makes this medium so accessible.  Learn how to take your skills to the next level. Do you appreciate a straightforward teaching style?   I will talk you through the process that I use to approach each of my pieces from a simple tulip to a more complex still life.  You will watch as I draw and narrate a complete piece.  I can show you tips, techniques, and ideas that you can build upon with your own style and preferences.  I also make myself available to my Patrons to answer questions and offer suggestions for improvement. If you would like to see a sample of my past work to get a feel for the quality of art you can expect to learn from me, check out the free preview videos that accompany most new tutorials on this site.  Here is an example of one of my recent preview videos.   https://www.patreon.com/posts/magnolia-branch-6157... What if I don't speak English? Many of my Patrons do not speak English.  All of my videos are available with auto-translated closed captioning in over 60 languages.  And, much can be learned by simply observing. No commitment!  While this is a membership site, you are free to cancel and re-join at any time.  At only $7/month until you cancel, this is a really good deal! My life has been greatly enriched since I discovered the joys of drawing botanicals with colored pencils!  I look at nature and art with new eyes.  I have discovered a community of interesting, inspirational, and encouraging artists that I am so proud to be a part of.  Watching videos like the ones I am now creating was the way I learned to draw and I am excited to be passing that gift along.  I hope you will join me!"},

A lot of people were asking for more Original Life, and this page was put together so they could support it, and make it worth taking time away from everything else I have to work on, ensuring the comic's longevity. No matter what:  I will be doing Original Life pages on a sporadic schedule, as I have time.  These pages will be free. Where will these pages be readable?  Here on Patreon, as well as my blog: http://jrn-arts.tumblr.com/ As time goes on I'll probably offer .zip file archives of entire page sets for easier downloading to Patreon contributors. Contributors will also be able to read pages a week in advance, before they become free. If this Patreon meets its stretch goal, I will devote time out of my current schedule to specifically ensure a regular and reliable uploading schedule for new pages. Supporters, here, will receive additional work material and illustrations connected with the comic. Please see the reward tier descriptions for more details! When will there be new pages?   Starting sometime in April, 2018, I will begin the new pages. Until then, this place will be mostly populated with preliminary sketches, discussion, and some test pages as I get a feel for how I want the new material to look."},

I'll guess you've already listened to the podcast, that we share a love of good, true, and beautiful things, that we're in the trenches of life together, seeking to \"rejoice though we've considered all the facts\" (Wendell Berry). I have a hunch that you care about cultivating your interior life, enriching your soul, becoming a source of wisdom and kindness for others. I also have a hunch you may know that I (Joy) am in the throes of finishing a Phd in Theology, Imagination, and the Arts at St Andrews University on the sparkling coast of Scotland. If so, welcome to my Patreon.  Patreon provides a platform for you to support my work and share in my journey toward completing a Phd.  You can find out more about each tier of Patreon through the tabs on the right, but first, let me tell you the story of how Patreon came to be, what I do on Patreon, and what you can expect from this community. In 2017, passionate about the power of story and beauty to help shape us into well-rounded people who think with complexity and compassion about the world, I started  Speaking with Joy.  A brand new doctoral student in theology at the cusp of an academic career, I could never have imagined what a life giving force this podcast would become in my own life, deepening my convictions, strengthening my voice, and connecting me with kindred spirits all over the world. But I also couldn't have imagined how much completing a doctorate would require of me:  intellectually, emotionally, socially, financially. Completing a Phd can be a profoundly isolating experience. Conflicting forces pull you in two directions at once, toward the hurricane's eye of a research vortex on the one hand, and into the storm of training, presenting, and speaking to make sure you (and your CV) are ready to get a job when you're done. And while this storm rages you also have to work enough to eat, go to church, and sometimes even hang out with friends (lol it's 2020... who are we kidding?!). It is no wonder Phd students are  three times more likely than others to be anxious or depressed. At the end of my first year, I realised that I needed financial support on this journey if I was going to be able to finish the Phd on time and maintain a modicum of sanity. I knew I wanted to continue producing the podcast, but that I couldn't do that unless it became a source of income. I could not sustain producing the podcast, attending to my academic duties, and working to provide for my day to day needs. I trusted that if the podcast really were worth my time, a part of my calling, God would provide, and people would come alongside me; God did, and you have.  Through the financial support of Patreon, I am able to continue my doctoral studies and the podcast. I also had an inkling that I needed a network of support, encouragement, and prayers, something to anchor me, and keep the vision clear for why I do what I do, both in research and in the podcast. This was the support I didn't know to ask for, the gift I was surprised and delighted to be given. Over the past year,  Patreon has become a source of immense encouragement to me, given me a place to more privately (than the internet, writ large) to recount the victories and challenges of my studies, a community of people who have cheered me on and given me ideas.   In thanks for the financial and verbal generosity of my patrons on this site, I enjoy sharing fun bits of extra \"content\" (I really despise this vacuous word): a monthly newsletter (the Joynal!), playlists, secret podcasts, recipes, pictures, and short essays. And this year (2020), I've started a new endeavour: a reading and discussion club! Each week, I'll post a reading, a podcast on that reading, a short essay about it, and discussion questions. The readings will always be small, and available somewhere for free online. I started this after the wonderful success of this  year's summer book club on Julian of Norwich . (you can retroactively read the posts if you join). Generally speaking, the $2 tier involves playlists, Joynals, and booklists. And the $10 tier involves that AND the weekly secret podcasts. My patrons are my podcast inner circle. The first people I'll tell when things are on the move. The people I'll ask for prayers. The people upon whom I'll premier writing ideas. The patreon is not a \"product\" I produce for your purchase, it's a community of support, inspiration, and shared delight. I lean on my patrons, but I hope they enjoy stories and songs and ponderings I share in the leaning... and I love learning from you as well. Well, I'm rambling (a very realistic depiction of my patreon posts), but I hope that has given you a sense of what this space is for. If it sounds like something something you'd enjoy, join in! I'd love to have you along for the journey.  Oh, and you're all going in the acknowledgements of my Phd. Much love, friends. Peace, Joy"},

My Patreon is a place to see all of my artwork first, get a behind the scenes look with works in progress, ask questions, vote for new designs to be made and much more! I also offer a limited monthly print and sticker club. There is also a digital club where you can receive coloring pages and wallpapers! What happens here? I currently draw 2 designs for Patreon each month. In the beginning of the month, patrons vote on which designs get made! One design is early access, and one design is \"Patreon Preferred\". This is a place to chat with each other, collect feedback and help decide which designs get made and to even help decide how the final design looks!  Each month I also share the process and BTS of creating these artworks with patrons. I also tend to draw a few bonus early access designs each month that patrons get to see before anyone else! Patrons also get to suggest a new series or character that they would like to see included in future polls from time to time. I really try to make this community with your feedback in mind, and I love creating beautiful art together. I'm so appreciative that you're here checking it out! "},

We work daily to bring you the most special stuff we find, those hidden little gems that still can get you all hyped up and kept unnoticed all the time. Indiemono started as an independent Spotify profile where we hosted different playlists from our curation, frequently updated and focused in different music genres and moods - now it's the base channel you need to visit to understand who we are...  you may find a playlist for your exact mood today!      \n \nWhen we began our journey, we started receiving hundreds of messages from artists and bands, undiscovered and with the need of help. So we decided to focus our path on them, as the music industry nowadays has a really small pool of artists and there is enough highlight for them. There is a lot of work done and in progress like \n creating a solid community of independent curators  to give a boost to the talent, a  music submission system  for us to sort, review and feed playlists with those songs and the  editorial power to display and show all of it  through our site.\n \n \nNow, our new path is \n building the best and fairest digital label of all times . We're considering artists and establishing a solid network of promotion. Our future will be promoting them and introduce them to the world, so stay tuned! \n \n We're a small team of two \n \n \n Carlos , who is the curator and the builder of Indiemono's music ecosystem vision - He's filled with discipline and real passion for music. He basically spends his time working around playlists, attending concerts and planning trips around the world. He has the most amazing ideas for innovation around music and he's so eager to make them happen. \nAnd me,\n  Dam , a geek that loves design, illustration and literature. I currently work in projecting systems to make our life easier and be able to do more with less. I also talk with the people who connects with us and take care of the art. My free time is for video games and my recently built little urban orchard right at the heart of Madrid. \n \nIt's just us and our time, so we need a little help to keep our system and, with a little luck, be able to devote 100% of our time to Indiemono.  \n \n \n \n So, what do we need? \n \n A lot of work is needed to give foundations to our vision of equity and justice in the music industry, so we're officially opening our Patreon to ask you for help in sharing the journey with us. What we can promise you is that you'll find amazingly talented artists and bands that are eager for you to take a listen and give them feedback. If you're able to support us with 1$ a month it would mean a lot to us. We'll be opening new tiers, rewards and features really soon!   We appreciate your support and love even if you can't contribute as a patron. \n \n \n \n So welcome, we hope you like it here."},

Can you help support the project?  We are showing the world that sanctuaries needn´t be full of sad tales or need to manipulate people into giving through tears and horror stories. All of our animals are winners, they are survivors and we look to build new centres, new sanctuaries based on this ethos. Our documentary series and webisodes will help us communicate that ethos to a wider audience. It will help us educate people to recognise exploitation and show them that they can make the choice not to support it. Please help us and join the Jacobs Ridge family as we move forward. Julian Nicholson and Rachael Wheeler have collectively been running the sanctuary for over 13 years and the development has been slow and hard. Dedication and passion has been the greatest resource and now as the team builds, that dedication is making real change."},

I'm a 3D artist and I love making toys. I've been making art toys for over a year now with my 3D printer, it's so much fun to see my imagination coming to life. So I decided to not keep all the little creatures for myself, and I want to share my designs and see other versions from everyone who loves making toys as well. In order for me to keep creating all the fun little Grumpii monsters for you guys, I will need your support. By supporting me, you are helping Grumpii improve as an artist and grow as a brand. Creating is always my passion, and you are supporting my dream. I'm so excited to share my passion with you all and I'm super thankful for your support!!! What do you get? - You will have access to the monthly release. - Access to the  Current  month. For example, if you join my Patreon in August (current) you will get access to August only, you can't access July or months before that. If you  FORGET  to download the files or  MISS  the designs from all the months before that, you will have to purchase them separately. I will be listing them online, not all designs will be listed. (discount codes for patrons only) How many designs do I get? - I will release 3~4 original designs every month. When does the download link expire? -  11:59 PM  EST  at the end of every month. I recommend not signing up for Patreon at the last minute. Patreon will charge you for the next month instead which will cause a lot of confusion. What happens if I forget to download the file? -  Please don't forget to download and save your files somewhere safe. If you forget/miss/lose the files, they will be gone next month, I will close all access to the previous download links. What about fanart? - I will spend 99% of my time creating original designs, but if fanart is what you all really like, I will let you guys vote on that. Where are my files? - You will be able to download the files directly from Patreon. Spread the words - Besides supporting Grumpii via Patreon, I'll be very happy if you share images or videos of my designs on any social media platforms.

Digital files are Never for sharing or selling.

BAIA’s mission is to document, preserve and promote the contributions of the African American arts community.  THE BLACK ART IN AMERICA (BAIA) FOUNDATION  is a 501c3 organization that applies what we’ve learned over our 12 years as a multifaceted arts company to facilitate the growth of artists while cultivating the relationships and opportunities that bring Black artists and communities together. THE BAIA FOUNDATION  believes that a significant challenge for communities of color is their lack of access to and education on the visual arts, particularly those that effectively reflect and represent themselves.  \n \n \n\t \n \n In the last 12 years, BAIA has generated thousands of hours of free, original content. This includes (but certainly is not limited to): BAIA Bits - “Little moments where knowledge meets art” - We’ve recently added audio with subtitles as well.  Three-Pieces, which feature background information and three artworks by artists who are represented by BAIA Featured articles, which cover interviews, gallery exhibits, and everything else related to the art world (visual art, fashion, music, interior design, and more) Profiles on artists, collectors, and industry professionals And, as of this year, thanks to Patrons like you, we've introduced our quarterly, nationally-distributed print version of BAIA The Mag. \n \n \n\t \n \n Goals of THE BAIA FOUNDATION:  To center the legacy of African-American art and artists through visual art, literature, lesson plans, oral histories, and the distribution of our bi-monthly magazine To promote intersections between art and activism in Black neighborhoods and schools while encouraging a strong sense of purpose and unity and using art as a catalyst for economic development To create opportunities for Black artists and writers to grow by facilitating their skill sets, giving them the space and tools to create, and expanding their professional networks. 2022 – Initiatives: Distribute BAIA, the mag, to the 107 HBCUs in the country Design art centered lesson plans for middle schools, summer camps, and homeschoolers  Fund artists lead community impact based workshops and programs targeting the youth and seniors  Launch (virtual) professional development series Institute marketing assistance for African American Museums and Cultural Centers.  How to Get Involved: Become a stakeholder who helps us transform lives through art.  Becoming a Patreon contributor. \n\t \n\t \n\t Everything we do at BAIA happens, in part, because of the support we get from our Patreon contributors.

I am Fluff-Kevlar / Fluff / Kev, a solo artist drawing mostly  adult/NSFW  anthro/furry artwork. I also draw other content such as MLP, human/anime, etc art from time to time. My original content centers around Sci-Fi and Tribal settings. I do not take any of this support for granted, and try very hard to create fun, unique content that I (and hopefully you) like! \n \n Goal of this Patreon- This and my SubscribeStar(another pledge option with mirrored content and bonuses) supports my bills, food, and general living expenses as a fleshy human. Self-employment is a heavy weight to swing, and your support goes into things that most jobs get already: sick days, retirement.. TAXES. \n \n How this works- \nI dislike pay-walled art; my work will always be posted \npublicly for free, usually a few months after Patreon. However, depending on the tier, you can  see work   earlier, vote, give feedback,  join some private streams , see any alternate versions,  and  in   higher resolutions ! This way, I can say \"thank you\" without turning my art into a paywall. Only pledge what you think my work is worth!  I will do my best to make it worthwhile. Every dollar counts, and every patron is equally important to me, since I know people change tiers all the time. At the beginning of each month I'll post here,  in my Patreon Feed , a link to a ZIP file of all the art made in the previous month. My Patreon charges upfront, so you'll be able to see the post right away if your pledge processes. Just scroll down my feed to the beginning of each month and find the Sketch, HD, or PSD post for your tier. Or to find a month quickly, use the  \"reward\" tag  when viewing my posts. \n\t \n\t I f you want some old content-   For each month you pledge, you can PM me on Patreon requesting  one previous month 's content (of your same tier). For example, if you pledged in July, you'd have access to July, and can also request, say...February's content in addition. You can also buy the most recent several month's HD ZIP files from my E-Junkie store \n\t HERE . \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t In short- \n\t\t\tThe goal is to provide \n\t\t\t everyone  with the best art that I can do, that would otherwise not be funded, while giving those that  do  donate some extra files and bonuses as a \"Thank you\" for letting me do this full time! \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t[To send me a PM, click the 'Overview' tab,  \n\t\t\tand then the box that says \"More\" under my icon. \n\t\t\tThere you'll see the 'message' option.]\n\t\t \n\t \n"},

The page is currently paused but will reopen February first 2022 See you soon! My name is  Iris Compiet  and I'm an artist living and working in the Netherlands. As a child I grew up on stories like those of the  brothers Grimm  and  Hans Christian Andersen . You know, the 'real' dark fairytales where hearts and lungs were eaten, where hands were chopped off and evil queens had to dance in red hot shoes until they died! A passion for myth, fantasy and legends were present at an early age, I vowed to become an artist...  I'm the creator of a book called  Faeries of the Faultlines . This book was funded through Kickstarter and marked the beginning of a big adventure. Ever since I was 7 and picked up  Faeries  by  Alan Lee  and  Brian Froud , he actually wrote the intro to my book, I was fascinated with this  Other world . And now I was going to add my voice to these stories. What began with daily sketches for #mermay and #junefae in 2016 opened up a world I started calling the Faultlines. This Patreon page is giving me the opportunity to dive deeper into this world, to bring you the stories and show you the creatures that lurk behind root, stone, mud and water. The beasts that soar through the skies. To take you on an adventure through these vasts lands as I'm discovering new faeries each and every day.  Patreon is giving me the opportunity to explore and write new stories, experiment with new media and it allows me to give something back at the same time. Because this page is not about me. It's about YOU as a patron. I hope this page will give you an insight in what it takes to be a full time artist.

My focus at first will be on producing narrated easy to follow Pastel Painting videos. Each month I will be producing two videos for only £4 a month, by pledging you with gain full access to all my Tutorials...  1) A 4 hour long Pastel tutorial... all the complete  footage slowed down to almost realtime, as well as real time viewing in some of the important areas, enabling you to follow every mark I make. 2) As an extra thank you for pledging, I will produce an exclusive real-time video with real-time audio explaining my procedure step by step on a specific aspect of pastel painting and other information you might find useful.  I have over 30 years experience to share with you... so really excited about doing just that. How do I easily find the tutorials I want to see? Use  www.daveportersart.co.uk/patreon  to easily navigate to the tutorials you want to follow. Also, if you are considering becoming a patron you can use this website to check out the library of tutorials I have on Patreon and navigate from there.  What are the benefits? The video library will grow each month...  I will be uploading on the first Wednesday of each month an exclusive re-edited content for my Patreons, this will be an (approximately 4 hour long) full length video tutorial, which will be more in-depth than the ones on my YouTube channel, exploring from beginning to the finished artwork  All the footage will be uploaded so you can pause at any point to take a closer look. Along with real-time footage, there will also be very slightly speeded up footage to ensure you can still see every stroke and mark I make (the reason for this is so I can reduce the length to around 4 hours). Some of my work can take many hours to complete.  As an extra thank you for pledging... I will produce in the middle of each month a selective part or the whole footage of my free YouTube content footage but with real-time video and Audio so you can follow along in more detail and see step by step how I achieve the results in the moment plus the benefit of me explaining the method as I create the work... so enjoy and thanks for your support... it means the world to me.  :-) What will I gain from the experience? My passion is to help you develop your own unique style with creating realistic and soulful artwork by keeping everything nice and simple and uncomplicated. I use mainly three primary colours, the three complimentary colours and a few earth colours to create the realism. Keeping everything relaxed and harmonious is really important to me; I have been on a personal spiritual journey for over 30 years uncovering how the mind can influence our work and sense of well being, so I give pointers to help you to relax and embrace the joy of just being whilst drawing and painting. So for the price of a cup of coffee each month, I am offering my many years of experience at an affordable price. All this in one tier for just £4+ VAT.  Unlocking exclusive re-edited content especially created just for my Patreons.  By pledging, this will open further exciting opportunities to focus on producing more detailed video content especially for you. How do the payments work? \n\nMonthly\nMembership: As a new patron, your payment will be processed on the day you\nbecome a patron which gives access to all the videos in my library, then on the\n1st of the month going forward. Thank you so much for considering becoming a patron, I would really appreciate the support! Don't worry there is no contract, you can cancel at anytime you like... so why not give it a go. Come join our community :-) Be sure to comment and say hello and let me know what kind of videos you'd like to see.

I’ve been drawing ever since i could hold a pencil and got heavily into drawing anime/manga back in middle school! Art has always been a huge part of who i am as a person and i've always strived to make the most of my little hobby. Now im 27 years old and working towards creating art as a full time occupation, and have decided on trying a Patreon to make that process a bit easier for myself ♥ If you wish to support me and stick with me through this journey of mine I would be forever grateful! Any kind of support is always appreciated ♥ My content here will mainly consist of fanart and fanmerch from My Hero Academia, as that is my biggest inspiration and fandom right now! My favorite characters are Bakugou and Kirishima, so you will be seeing a lot of them here haha Im pretty new to drawing fanart and making merchandise of my own, but it is something that brings me a lot of joy and hope to be able to share that with you all through the different tier options i have available! There will be opportunities to even vote and help decide on what future store merch and patreon-exclusive merch i do ^^ FAQ 1. When will i be charged? Patrons are charged up front when they pledge. This means that you will be charged the day you become a patron, giving you access to all content shared within your reward tier for the current month! Payments will then reoccur every first of the month after the initial charge 2. When are rewards distributed? after payments are processed for the month; discount codes are posted in the beginning of the month, physical rewards are mailed out when the month is over, and digital rewards are posted throughout the month! 3. Will you have patreon merch in your store later?/How can i get merch rewards from previous months? All merch made for patreon are patreon exclusive! There is a new set of pins every month, meaning that in order to receive a certain pin you must pledge within that pin's month. (Ex: pledge in august to receive august's pin, etc) I have no intention on selling patreon merch in my store aside from in mystery bags, but i will be setting up a patreon-exclusive store for patrons to purchase previous merch rewards at a later date 😊 4. Can i change/cancel/upgrade my pledge? you can always change, upgrade, or cancel your pledge at any time! Since you pay up front when you pledge: - If you increase your pledge, you'll be charged the difference between your current tier amount, and your new tier amount, giving you access to the new tier's content instantly.  - When you cancel or downgrade your pledge, it will be reflected in the following month, not the current month. 5. How do you grade your pins? I am not a strict pin grader as pins are handmade and none are perfect. The pin you receive for each month will be either an A or B-grade pin, which i consider standard. These pins may have one or two minor flaws such as small spots or specks, light scratches, etc, but these flaws will not take away from the overall look of the pin! In general I do try to ensure that you are getting the best of the batch! "},

Think of it less like a Patreon and more like a fan club. A fan club that will allow me to create more of what you would really like to see from me. Most exciting is you'll get to watch me create my next graphic novels from the ground up! I'll share scripts, concept art, works-in-progress and finished pages before they are ever released into the wild. I'll also be providing comic-making tips and tutorials. With almost fifteen years professionally making comics under my belt, I'd love to pass on some of that knowledge to all of you.

Please note, new Patrons will be charged at signup, and then monthly, or annually on the same date. I started drawing when I was knee-high to a grasshopper, but didn’t pick up my first brush until the age of eleven. For many years I have undertaken watercolour, oil, acrylic and graphite commissions and have painted portraits, landscapes and animals. I now paint as a full time artist and have over 40 years experience. I love every minute of my work! My\nPatreon channel allows me to pass on my passion for watercolours. I love to teach others the techniques I use\nto create my wildlife portraits, and love even more to see the results that they achieve.  I do much prefer to film myself painting whilst chatting away at the same time, rather than recording a voice-over after the painting is done. To me, the way I do this gives you the feeling as if you are with me, sat by my side whilst I chat to you showing you what to do. For those of you who are not familiar with Patreon, I've given a brief overview below.  Once again, thank you for looking at my page and I look forward to working with you. Patreon is a subscription based platform; once you are a member you get\naccess to the entire   back catalogue of video tutorials    with new content\nuploaded monthly.  I am using my channel to teach others how to use the exciting medium of\nwatercolour to paint  wildlife.  Take a look at what others have  achieved already  through my tuition.  I have years of experience, let my\nfriendly tuition help you avoid the mistakes I’ve made, and don’t forget to\nclear a wall for all the lovely artwork you will soon be creating! There are 3 levels of subscription depending\non what you want.  You can change your\nsubscription and your level at any time. Should you be unsure whether my style of\ntuition will suit you have a go at painting a  robin   from start to finish. \n\n \n\n PDF Club  gives you access to all  project photos and drawing guides  and a full step-by-step written guide for the\n current  month’s  main  lesson.  You will have access to the community support pages, our private Facebook group and a variety of tips, techniques and some shorter tutorials too. \n\n \n\n Video Club  gives you access to  ALL  the above\ncontent  PLUS  a main project video tutorial and a shorter tutorial too.  This may be a study, a standalone tutorial or something you can add into a wildlife project.  I explain everything as I\npaint, I only speed up repetitive sections and I don’t use jargon!  Take a look at the  back catalogue  of\nprojects - you will have instant access to ALL of these. Exclusive Club  gives you access to  ALL  the above content,  PLUS  optional access to this content via my personal website.  You will be set up as a guest member and receive log in details, this offers an easier way to find the content quickly.  At this level, you also get 25% discount off all my previous PDF tutorials. \n\n \n\n Enough of me - finally, this is what some of my members have to say\nabout my Patreon channel.

Begun in 2014, the series comprises over 200 episodes that tackle a wide variety of subjects and share the work and approaches of a diverse range of artists.  Created, written, and hosted by Sarah Urist Green, The Art Assignment explores ideas and questions about art ( What is Art?  and  Love the Art, Hate the Artist ), analyzes art news and events ( The $150,000 Banana ), and makes cases for artists and movements ( Performance Art  and  Yoko Ono ). The series also explores the eating and cooking lives of artists ( Eat Like Andy Warhol ), and takes trips to art capitals both expected and unexpected ( Venice ,  Marfa , and  Tijuana ). We have a tremendous back catalogue of episodes that serve as a rich resource for educators, creators, and students of all ages and levels.  Starting in August of 2020, the series is taking a break for creative renewal and reassessment, and then will publish new videos on a much slower basis (no more than 6 per year ).  Because of this, we have transitioned our account from \"monthly\" to \"per episode\" contribution. If you have been a monthly contributor (and we thank you for that), this new scenario will cost you much less per year.  If at any point we decide to increase production, we will announce the news loudly and allow you time to adjust your support.  Your support is still critically important to us!  We greatly appreciate your contribution to this series, and to The Art Assignment community. Our series is a production of  Complexly , which brings you other such educational series as Crash Course, SciShow, Origin of Everything, Eons, Journey to the Microcosmos, and many others.  This page is managed by The Art Assignment and Complexly."},

Creating  free and low-cost resources on herbalism and magickal arts  is nourishing work that I am called to. Teaching students and facilitating magickal gatherings both  online  and  in-person  feels right deep down in my bones. Soon I’ll be celebrating a decade of running  Worts + Cunning Apothecary  and this year I want to start a new tradition. Some of you may already be familiar with the tradition I’m about to describe and for others of you it’ll be a bit of a strange and unfamiliar concept. I want to be able to pay all my bills and have enough money leftover to create new things (A documentary style podcast on magickal culture! A book you can hold in your hands and spill tea on! Magickal gatherings featuring nice people doing kind things!). I then want to go even further (beyond easily paying my bills and doing things like taking regular time off and  not  doing things like walking around with a cracked tooth for months because I can't afford to go to the dentist) and collaborate with and compensate other people in creative endeavors. I have begun to realize that this thing of financial security is a thing that can be done and I’m interested in doing it.  I want to be able to easily run my business for decades to come while still having the majority of what I create given away for free.  In the process of creating such space to breathe and create in my life I want to help make it happen in the lives of others, too. By becoming a patron you would be helping to cast a circle wide enough for me to create more and give back to our community in ways that is sustainable and engaging.  I want to create more quality in your life and not just make more noise (except, when we need some holy sacred irreverent blissful noise).   I would continue to create free and low-cost content, design new classes, and finally do the projects I feel called to but have felt unable to pursue because of financial instability. As our community grows you’ll know that you’re not only supporting me, but the other folks I support through free and low-cost classes and services as well as the many other causes I rally behind (like community herbal clinics, Black Lives Matter, justice work at the border, and queer and sober gathering places). In the short term, the projects that I will be working on through the support of patrons like you are: A Book ( finally ) No one is surprised that I’m trying to write a book. But I’ve been surprised (and not surprised at all) at how hard it is to write a book with the dread of financial instability hanging over one’s head. I want to write a book - even though I’m terrified to write a book - and I’m going to do it. Patron support will help me spend more time on book writing! More High Quality Free Resources for Plant Nerds, Modern Witches, and Tired Hags Patron support means that I get to keep doing what I (and presumably you) love: creating the type of content that inspires folks to know their magick, trust their story, and reweave themselves back into their communities. I want to write more about creating accessibility in our practices both professional and personal so we can show up to the world in all of wonder and weirdness. Right now my blog work is unpaid work - having financial backing means that I could expand what I’m doing in a way that promotes longevity and not burnout in my life. That would be rad. I'd also like to be able to offer all of my in-person classes as donation based with no one turned away for lack of funds because the ability to folks to gather together in supportive spaces is needed now more than ever.  So you’re invited to become a patron, join the club of me being ridiculously grateful for your support, and make the work that I do even more possible than it is now.  I am so excited for what we might create together - thanks for choosing to come along. In mirth + reverence, Alexis J. Cunningfolk Just in case you arrived here unexpectedly in the middle of the night or from a parallel but distinct enough dimension where I'm a cool and suave barista by day and superhero by night and not an herbalist and you have no idea who I am or what I do (intersectional herb- what?), here is a brief synopsis: My name is Alexis J. Cunningfolk (she/they) and I'm an intersectional herbalist and witch who runs  Worts + Cunning Apothecary . Through the practices of herbal healing, magickal arts, and sound therapies both ancestral and modern, I help folks to re-enchant the world and their lives by re-membering themselves back home through their magick. My work is informed by my queerness, mixed ancestry, and that I'm a young hag just waiting for time to catch up. I host  online  courses for starry-hearted healers grounded in building communities of inclusivity and justice. And I drink a lot of tea.  Welcome!"},

Thank you for viewing my page~ Questions and Concerns   (Please read especially if it is your first time using Patreon and are not sure how it works! I get frequently asked some of these): - Subbing to higher tiers means you will ALSO receive awards of all tiers below it. - Right after subbing: for downloadable rewards that are not the video rewards, you will have to wait until the 1st of the next month for me to send it into your inbox! - You will be able to see video rewards for previous months directly after becoming a Patron! The videos will only be accessible on my Patreon page. I may slowly remove old videos after several months, but there will always be at least 3 to 5 months worth of videos available.  Old, removed videos will be made available on Gumroad. -Your account will be charged on the first of every month. I will have a new reward for each tier every month, of at least one artwork.   -Some downloadable rewards will be sent into your Patreon inboxes (which should notify you by email too, unless you unsubscribed from the list or something). - The program I'm using is Paint Tool Sai at the moment, and occasionally CSP! Therefore all process / videos will apply best to users of this program.  -Not in the Discord server?

Prior to the tear \ngassing, soldiers surrounded us kicking at our bodies and heads. Full  account here . Video  here . Since 2007 I've been writing from and on issues in the Middle East, mainly occupied Palestine and in recent years Syria, fighting for its existence under a foreign war of aggression. In 2017, I was short-listed for the \nprestigious Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism. The award rightly was \ngiven to the amazing journalist, the late Robert Parry [see  his work on Consortium News ]. \n In March 2017, I was \nawarded “International Journalism Award for International Reporting” \ngranted by the Mexican Journalists’ Press Club (founded in 1951). \nCo-recipients included: John Pilger and political analyst Thierry \nMeyssan. What I offer is years of actual on-the-ground experience,  which continues  with every investigative trip I make to Syria, Venezuela, Crimea, Donbass... My concerns in my writings, interviews and lectures are primarily an end\n to the Imperialist, Zionist, Gulf and allies' wars and invasions (and aggressive acts like sanctions) against \nsovereign nations and innocent people, as well as holding not only the \naggressors but the lying, war-propagandizing media accountable and \nexposing their complicity. I refuse to compromise my\n principles and beliefs, and refuse to endorse the corporate media which\n brings us almost exclusively Fake News. As you can imagine, doing so and remaining true to my integrity and \nvalues means that I don't contribute to corporate media, but rather a \nvariety of independent media, the sole exception being \nsometimes-contributions to the Op-Edge section of RT.com. A list of the different media I've contributed to in recent years can be found on the right hand side of  my blog . As  I have written before , writing with integrity either doesn't pay period, or \npays very little. I may take one day, or up to a week or more for a single article \nand receive $50, or for some sites I've contributed to, nothing at all--but I do \nso for the message and the sharing of important news or testimonies.  In recent years, I added a\n \"donate\" button to my blog, after readers repeatedly asked me how they \ncould support me. Otherwise readers have kindly out of the blue sent me money, such as one very generous Lebanese reader after  I wrote about the silence around terror attacks on Lebanon and Syria , including visiting the terrorist-attacked areas of Bourj al-Barajneh, Beirut, and al-Zahra'a, Homs. \n In January, a colleague suggested I join \nPatreon, but I kept delaying, instead prioritizing finishing writings \nbased on my  2016 Syria visits  and then my June 2017 visit (see:  Syria War Diary: What Life Is Like Under ‘Moderate Rebel’ Rule ).  However,\n I've finally decided to venture onto Patreon in hopes that an actual \nand steady income can allow me to delve into the realm of interviewing interesting people, \nwhich I will open up here on Patreon, also posting writings, \nvideos, photos and... we'll see what develops! With my \nextensive experience in occupied Palestine, Syria, participation in \nconferences, and years of writing, and  my recent visit to the DPRK/North Korea , my contacts list is quite long, and \nI'm sure many of those who have interviewed me in the past wouldn't mind\n taking stage to share their knowledge. If you support this endeavour, welcome to my page. Coming up in the near future, some interesting interviews and discussions on North Korea, Syria and other important issues people may still be confused on.

I'm a Cheshire-based cartoonist, and while I've previously worked as a storyboard artist for over three years I am taking the plunge to try and make my own work my main source of income, woo!  If you'd like to see some examples, please head over to my main website  JolleyComics.com  - there are lots of fun things to click on, amongst which there are animations, short illustrated stories, written works and individual art pieces but to name a few! One of the larger incentives to start up this patreon is that, due to health reasons, I have been told that I cannot both draw for a professional living and do my own work outside of it. I would very probably shrivel up and die without being able to draw and write my own work, and consequntly the logical step is to endeavour to make my own work my professional living! There is also a rather real possibility that I will not be able to draw for the rest of my life, as the joints in my fingers are affected by the condition and will likely get worse as I age, so the sooner I can focus all my energy on completing my stories the more likely I will be able to before it gets to that point. I've been very lucky with the people who have helped and supported \nme thus far, and I can't imagine how I could have done as much as I have\n without my family and friends. This is the next chapter, and while it \nis a frighteningly big step it would be churlish to put aside what they \nhave already given me without at least trying to make a go of it. If I am able to reach minimum wage with Patreon, I will be able to commit 100% of my time to working on the stories you guys want to read! I will also be able to do more exercise to prevent my body from falling to pieces, and I will be able to plan research trips to make the art I create that much more accurate and pretty! I will also be able to structure my time more efficiently, so that when I'm taking a break from the comic I can write something instead, or put aside a few hours to do a livestream of my drawing process! I will also be providing step by steps of how I make some of my work, and if you support me you can always put in a request of what kind of pictures you would like to see a 'guide to' version of. Who knows! If all goes well I may be able to start visiting conventions in other countries, to visit you and give you access to physical copies of the work that you'll be helping me to make! Please note that while most of my rewards will be posted as they occur, the larger rewards of the signed books and character cameos can only be received after payment due to the work required!"},

Let's queue the presentation paragraph, without putting you to sleep.  I am just someone who has grown up around video games, anime and technology, with a somewhat early interest for drawing.  It was a few years ago that I transitionned into the world of digital art to expand what I could create. My art is a mix of my love for the painterly and the anime aesthetics, a weird crossover I got interested in a long time ago, and the process has since stuck with me. From that point, I've been self-taught and am still learning about a lot of stuff, so if you are interested in seeing me grow throughout this journey, you can hop right in. You can see my work on:  [Twitter]   [Deviantart]   [Hentai-Foundry]  (NSFW obviously) I started this art journey for fun, but I decided to launch this patreon in the hopes that I could earn a little extra on the side and keep this thing going, as my time available is very limited and I pretty much don't earn anything from drawing these artworks. Thank you for all your support and for appreciating what I do, remember to only spend if you can afford it and wish to do so!

I'm Micah. \n \nI've always interacted with the world by making things, and by taking them apart to understand them. This was my reality. I had a weird childhood, and it was hard for me to connect with other people, but I could make things. It was like I could make my own tiny worlds. \n \nIt wasn't really the things themselves that I got attached to. I loved that experience of deeply understanding something, of creating something new. It felt like a kind of motherhood that anyone could experience. I wanted to share that experience with other people. \n \nAt a really young age, my dad sparked my interest in electronics and computers, but I quickly got interested in areas that he didn't have expertise in. So I turned to books, but books were expensive and they could be hard to find, and they didn't necessarily go that deep into things. So I learned to teach myself by experimenting. \n \nMost things don't require a lifetime of experience to understand. Most things, you can look at and understand them without having to understand all the pieces because the people who built them didn't necessarily understand all the pieces. To me, this understanding really represents freedom: freedom from a world where other people control and own all the technology around you. \n \nI got inspired by the open source software movement really early on, and I've spent most of the last 15 years making things that are often weird and complicated, but that I can give away for free. I've been lucky enough to create a few things that have been useful to others. For a while, I ran a  service  that helped other open source developers coordinate their work. I made  Fadecandy , a board that helps people make LED art. Most of these projects don't leave any legacy beyond my experiences of creating them and all the things I learn from those experiences. \n \nAfter haphazardly barely graduating university in Colorado while I was mostly working on my own projects, I moved to California and I got a job in Silicon Valley. I worked on things that were useful to a lot of people, but that internal beauty that had become so important to me was actually being intentionally hidden now. It felt very antithetical to my being to be working in this environment where you tell people not to look too closely at the software you're giving them. I really want to create things where you encourage everything to be dissected and understood. It's a compliment if someone wants to use your work to try to understand the field. \n \nSo, after 7 years of working in Silicon Valley and San Francisco, I burned out, I quit my day job, and started trying to find other things that would keep me going. Various things: art projects, software projects, contracting projects and my own things. But the thing that I've found the most enjoyment out of might be creating  videos  that document the process behind what I do. This takes something that would often be very obscure and hard for me to share, and it lets me communicate in a way that I think can be both educational and engaging. \n \nMy favorite things to create are things that other creators will enjoy, because I so enjoy the experience of creating things itself that I want to pass that experience on to other people. I'm often creating my own tools because I push myself to try things that aren't easy yet, then I push myself to give those tools away and make them accessible. \n \nVideo has been a really rewarding medium for me because I can really I think effectively share those tiny details that I get so excited about. It makes it easy to really zoom in on a particular part of the experience that I think people might find especially interesting, and to share that in this very carefully prepared way. \n \nSo, Patreon, this is how you can help. If you support me then I can spend more time just making things that you want to learn about, making content that really showcases the process, the details behind that part that you love and that I love, and not just making things that are going to be paved over with something else. You'll help me make more videos about electronics, more videos about art, more videos about the process that I go through to take things apart and understand them. More open source tools for making things and for taking them apart. \n \nIt's also an experiment in whether I can create tools and inspirational materials that are useful for other weirdos out there like me, who didn't really fit into the normal system and didn't learn about computers from school, but might learn about computers if they had the ability to tinker in the right ways. I think with my particular skills and knowledge I can make something out there that isn't really like anything else you can find. \n \nSo, with your help, I can keep making this stuff. I can keep trying to inspire other people who might learn the same way I learn, and most of all help people realize that it's in their power to figure things out no matter what."},

Since one whole year has passed, I have decided to offer an update of what has happened, and where this is going. MORE AUDIO What is going to be new is a podcast with audio versions of my lectures as well as readings from my books, starting with The Hammer of Greatness and The Seed of Yggdrasill.   Two new books and one new edition of an old book are coming out in 2022! An improved, edited and corrected version of The Maiden with the Mead The Goddess Idunn in Poetry and Myth Great Knowledge - Stories of Seidr and Fjölkyngi My name is  Maria Kvilhaug , and I am an author of both fiction and non-fiction, and a lecturer with an academic background, but working on my own. You could say I am also open for a mystical and spiritual approach to the myths of the past. They are deeply spiritual works of wisdom as far as I am concerned. I was born in 1975, what makes me 46 years old at the moment. I am Norwegian, and I do live in Norway, but because I had a decade of living in other countries and for various other reasons, I tend to write and present my lectures in English. Most recent interview with yours truly  here  ( Sacred You Podcast ) BOOKS PUBLISHED THE SEED OF YGGDRASILL  My readers know me mostly for my grand work on Old Norse poetical metaphors and how to use these to understand the deeper meanings of mythology, namely The Seed of Yggdrasill. THE MAIDEN WITH THE MEAD  Many of my readers are also aware of my earlier work, titled The Maiden with the Mead, which is about initiation rituals in the Poetic Edda and was, originally, a university thesis from 2004 (can be read for free online through  Oslo University Library ). NB! The Maiden with the Mead will be re-published by the  Three Little Sisters  in the start of 2022! THE POETIC EDDA - SIX COSMOLOGY POEMS  I have also written one book with translations of six Edda poems crammed with commentaries and explanations: The Poetic Edda: Six Cosmology Poems THE TRICKSTER AND THE THUNDERGOD  Then there is The Trickster and the Thundergod: Loki and Thor in Old Norse myths. This one presents all the myths in which Thor and Loki appear. Why the both of them? Because the two gods usually appear in the same myths, and often appear to be working together. BLADE HONER  Fortunately, some of my readers also know about my four novels which sort of make up a series that was intended to continue on, but which for economic and time- reasons has been postponed. The four books work very well on their own, however. Here are titles and links: 1.  The Hammer of Greatness 2.  My Enemy´s Head 3.  The Hel Rune´s Claim 4.  A Twisted Mirror  They portray life in the in the Norse-speaking settlement of Aldeigjuborg in Russia during the 790s, the very start of the Viking Age, when the Væringja Rus were pirates and landless men who had their cultural origin in Sweden, but who were naturally also influenced by their exile and their pirate lifestyles. It is seen through the eyes of a little girl, Thordís, who is fated to become a Thunder Priestess (Thorsgydja) and one of the women mound-laid at  Oseberg  in 834. THE THREE LITTLE SISTERS PUBLISHER All these books are now re-published with my wonderful publisher  The Three Little Sisters . They are also going to release a new edition of The Maiden with the Mead – A Goddess of Initiation Rituals in Old Norse Myths, in 2022. I have asked for some time to go through it, since it was written back in 2004 and I may want to do a few editions now after 17 years. FREE STUFF LADYOFTHELABYRINTH YOUTUBE  Adding to that, I run a YouTube channel – called The Lady of the Labyrinth, which was inspired by a Minoan title of a priestess from Crete; Labyrinthos Potnia. Before finishing The Seed of Yggdrasill, I published more than thirty YouTube lectures based on the research behind this book between, mostly, 2009 and 2013. WEBSITE  Then I went less active on YouTube for many personal reasons and because I was concentrating on my research and writings and articles – there is a website where many of these articles are published; named after my novel series; Blade Honer.  Bladehoner.wordpress.com. LECTURES, VIDEOS AND BOOK PROJECTS SINCE WINTER SOLSTICE 2021AND COMING: PATREON All this work is free and there for the taking. But in order to continue writing books and making lectures, I had to start financing the time and work it took, because we all have to make a living, pay our bills, all that - and doing this on my spare simply became too taxing. So, I opened a Patreon. I have never regretted that! It has been a lot of work, producing one or two lectures every month - but it is the work that I love the most, and it has enabled me to get very close to finishing two new book manuscripts! I want to extend a great roaring THANKYOU THANKYOU  THANKYOU to the people who have helped me out by paying me a little for the work I put into it. THANKYOU. It almost feels like you saved my life. Really. And let me tell you about what you have done for me. The two new books that will be published - as a result of people being willing to pay for my lectures, are the following: IDUNN BOOK  Apart from a re-publishing of the Maiden with the Mead, there will be a book based on my Patreon lecture series  The Goddess Iðunn in Poetry and Myth . This book will be published very shortly, in 2022! SEIÐR BOOK  The other book which may hopefully also get through within 2022 is based on my 2021 Patreon lecture series  Fjǫlkyngi – Stories of Seiðr and Initiation . The manuscript for the first part will be ready in 2022, but I don’t know how fast the publisher will be able to get it out! I will get back to what this project is all about shortly. SUMMARIES Last year, in 2020, I made an intro video for the winter solstice, where I presented my new project, namely the one where I wrote and produced lecture videos on Norse mythology and pre-Christian religion for paying patrons at my Patreon. Since one whole year has passed, I have decided to offer an update of what has happened, and where this is going. THE NEW COMING BOOKS: Let us return to the projects based on lectures available on Patreon: 1. THE IDUNN BOOK AND LECTURE TRILOGY: The Iðunn-book is based very closely on three lectures, each one about two hours long, that I published on Patreon in January and February 2021. If you are a patron, you may already be familiar with the content. If you are not, well, the videos are published on my Patreon, and you get the drift. Each lecture goes through one of the three sources in which Iðunn is described; 1.  The Skáldskaparmál 2. The Skaldic poem  Haustlǫng , which represents one of our oldest sources to Norse mythology, having been composed in its present form before the year 900, 3. And then the much debated Edda poem  Hrafnagaldr Óðins.  Each source provides some new insights into the Iðunn-lore. THE SEIÐR BOOK AND LECTURE SERIES: Over to Fjǫlkyngi. I am going to tell you what it is about very soon, but first the practical information: This book is based on the Patreon lecture series Fjǫlkyngi – Stories of Seiðr and Initiation, which I began in March 2021, and which is still ongoing, although I am getting close to finish the first part, and will be moving onto the part where we talk more in detail about the initiation rituals and initiation mysteries of the pagan lore. I just have to get through the episodes on berserksgangr, spirits and the summoning of spirits, and the theme of fylgjur and vættir and other máttugar – powers. First. These will begin to appear in January 2022. Then we will move onto the initiation stories. I have published about one or two lengthy lectures every month for the last ten months, so we are getting closer to twenty videos by now. All these videos are out on my Patreon. So far, they either are, or else they form smaller parts of - greater episodes with the themes of  basic information about 1.  What Fjǫlkyngi was , 2.  Oracular divination seiðr, 3.  The priestesses – the vǫlur who named children, 4. Practical seiðr for the purposes of  summoning the game , for  healing , influencing the  weather , f inding lost or hidden things  and so on - and people, including many stories of summoning powers, shape-shifting, out-of-body travel, things that are also well presented in episode 5 5. Harmful seiðr and saga-zombies; so called black magic:  The Nídstöng ,  Burial Customs ,  Necromancy , and  Waking the Dead 6. The sixth episode, which I just recently finished, dealt with  priestesses of war and human sacrifice ,  seiðr-men as mentors to kings, princes and warlords , and t he story of the conversion process in northern Europe , when many men who practiced seiðr were among the  fiercest opponents to the new religion in the religious battles  that followed. So; over to the book project: First of all, the lecture manuscript, as it is, is like a first or second draft. You, my dear patrons, are the reason I have gotten this far this fast. THANKYOU. If I am a bit slow on the next episode, please bear with me. I am going to have to spend some time going through this manuscript to make it into a book manuscript and not a lecture manuscript, and the book will also be even more extensive than the lecture series, as I discovered things on the way. There may also be a change in the order of things, and I have thought to change the title into “Great Knowledge – Stories of Seiðr and Fjǫlkyngi. Or, I am not sure, actually. You may suggest better titles if you are familiar with the content by now. The reason for this title, Great Knowledge, is because it is a direct translation of the term by which Norse-speaking pagans back in the Viking Age knew things that we might refer to as anything from shamanism to witchcraft and sorcery to oracular divination to poetry to spiritual mysteries and any form of sublime wisdom and knowledge: Fjǫlkyngi. Fjǫlkyngi – I am sure this word is not something that most people internationally are familiar with. In translations of saga literature, we usually only see words like sorcery or witchcraft where the word Fjǫlkyngi was applied in the original source. But the word actually directly translates as “Great Knowledge”. This Great Knowledge, Fjǫlkyngi, is an umbrella term which covers all sorts of pagan, esoteric arts; skaldskáp, as in poetry, seiðr, as in witchcraft and divination, galdrar, as in spell-songs, berserksgangr, as in battle ecstasy, out-of-body travel, summoning the spirits, changing shape, runes, healing and so on. Often reduced to a simple word; magic, in some way or other. OTHER CREATIONS AND COMING PROJECTS ON PATREON: 1. I will continue the Fjǫlkyngi series, ending the first part hopefully  before february 2022. 2. This work will form the draft of a new BOOK manuscript: GREAT KNOWLEDGE (working title) to be published in 2022-2023 3. The second part will begin in february/march 2022 and will be about INITIATIONS. 4. AUDIO mp3 files of my video lectures 5. Audio books (if I have time) Adding to this, I have also produced some other lectures and stuff that is out on Patreon: About various seasonal celebrations, About burial mounds in Vestfold  and other archaeological sites and cultural walks. AUDIO BOOK READINGS:  I have been trying to record chapter by chapter from my first novel,  The Hammer of Greatness , what has been a bit much amidst all the other things, and which was also surprisingly hard to put voice to. The voice of the book itself sounds, inside my head, like the voices of the people who tell the story, but when read out loud, it becomes different. It also contains some painful moments that were harder to say out loud than it was to write them. But I am, slowly, little by little, getting through the book – each episode already recorded is also out on my Patreon. Wish you a happy Yule and Winter Solstice PREVIOUS INTRODUCTION (2020-21) Biography Maria Kvilhaug\n(Oslo, Norway 1975-) is the author of  The Seed of Yggdrasill ,  The Maiden With The Mead   and the  Blade Honer  series, as well as other books, articles and lecture videos. Most of her works stem from her\nacademic background in the historical, cultural, linguistic and religious\naspects of pre-Christian Scandinavia.  From ca 2008-2016, she produced several videos on  LadyoftheLabyrinth YouTube channel,  but eventually slowed down because it became too much time-consuming and hard, unpaid work. She continued writing books and articles, though,  As of December, 2020, Maria began to post lecture videos for patrons. The economic support has and will encourage and finance more productions; videos, lectures, articles, books. The more support, the more time is freed to work on all of these things. So far, the support has helped birth a series of storytelling lectures about mythology and cultural history, with special focus on Seiðr.

Planned Mythology Lecture Themes for 2021  (feel free to suggest themes also) The Theme of Reincarnation in Old Norse Sources Myths of Initiation (a series) Stories about Seidr from Sagas and other Sources (a series) Valkyriur in Edda Poetry Readings from the Ynglinga Saga If there are livestream lectures, there will also be recordings of said livestream videos. For Those Who Know Me Already: Have you been missing more videos from the  Lady of the Labyrinth YouTube page ?  Are you among those who have asked me to make more  lecture videos , as I did so much back in 2009-2014? Or more  art-based mythology videos ?  Are you among those eagerly waiting for the next  Blade Honer  book? Are you among those who wish me to  publish my books in audio or video ? Are you among those who want to see those promised publications about Seidr, about Idunn, and about Initiation Stories, and so on? Would you have liked me to have more livestream lectures? Would you like to see recordings of live lectures/livestream lectures? Do you just like my work in general, such as my  website/blog , my  Facebook page , and want to see more articles published there?  If so, you might want to help me out by sponsoring my Patreon page so that I might get the time and energy I need to offer up all that - in great abundance! Why Patreon? For more than twelve years, I have been publishing articles, videos, and livestream lectures, and tried my best to reply to questions, and all of this is really  hard  work requiring a  lot of time and energy  - making an hour long lecture/video can take weeks of preparation! I have happily done all this work without asking anything in return from my readers and listeners, hoping that booksales would support my living. Well.  For the last few years, booksales have supported about 5% to 20% of my minimum necessity monthly income -  and this in a world where you simply need money to pay your bills and live a normal life - in my case in such an expensive country as Norway is. This means that, after a blissfull era of extreme creative energy, I burned out from the fact that I still had to aquire 95% - 80 % of my income by working hard labor as a healthcare worker. Anyone who works in healthcare knows how much that can dry up your extra resources.  So this is the simple math: The more patrons I can get to sponsor me by monthly payment, the more can I free up time and energy to create more videos, write more articles, make audio recordings of my books, and finish my book projects!  And if you do sponsor me, you are the ones who will be seeing my latest videos!  Sadly, the time of just giving away all that hard work for free is over.  I would have loved to make more videos and lectures free of charge, but I cannot afford it, and then they will not be made at all. It will also take a lot longer for more books to be finished, and fewer articles and research papers.   If you do sponsor me, you will get access to new videos of various themes and lengths, podcasts, lectures and heads up about new stuff! The more people sponsor me (and the more each are willing to pay), the more videos I pledge to make, including livestream lectures and audio recordings of my books - they will all be made available for those who are willing to help me out here, and you will be the first to be informed about new stuff that may come out.  I have not made special treatment for those who pay me more - I am sorry, but I really want to be accessible to anyone and I know what it is like to have few resources. However, if you can afford it, be aware that the more income I can get from this, the more will you get back also. I will simply get more time for this work.  \n\n What\nwill I offer my patrons? ‘ \n\nI will use\nPatreon to offer up special treats to those among my readers and listeners who\nare willing to sponsor me.  My offering in return will be talks and\npresentations in the form of videos, perhaps podcasting and even livestream\nlectures - to donating patrons only. Recordings of livestream lectures will be\nmade available to patrons. The more patrons I get, and the higher their\ndonations, the more time will I be able to spend time making great stuff for my\nreaders and listeners – and to write more books too (even the free stuff). I will not offer extra stuff to higher payers - but those who can and wish to sponsor me more than the minimum may dwell in the bliss of knowing that you are helping me make a living out of this and be able to produce more books and talks.    \n\n Themes I\ncurrently plan to cover in series of talks: \n\n Traditional Norwegian Folksongs –\nThemes, Origins and Performances \n\n Norwegian Folklore Stories \n\n Stories of Seid & Magic in the\nSagas \n\n Norse Mythology Stuff \n\n Readings from the Ynglinga saga \n\n Skaldskap – Our Oldest Literary Sources\nto Norse Mythology \n\n Readings from my books (fiction and\nnon-fiction) – like Audio Book chapters \n\n BOUNDARIES I cannot promise a lot of (or any) live\nchatting.  \n\n PRIMARY\nPUBLISHER:  The Three Little Sisters \n\n LIST OF BOOKS \n\n The Seed of Yggdrasill \n\n The Maiden with the Mead – A Goddess of Initiation in Old Norse Myths? \n\n The Trickster and the Thundergod – Thor and Loki in Old Norse Myths \n\n The Hammer of Greatness (Blade Honer I) \n\n My Enemy´s Head (Blade Honer II) \n\n The Hel Rune´s Claim (Blade Honer III) \n\n A Twisted Mirror (Blade Honer IV) \n\n The Poetic Edda – Six Cosmology Poems \n\n Alle netter ni"},

Several years ago, my life was changed forever when I experienced fire dancing for the first time at Burning Man. I endeavored to learn the art and channeled my heart and soul into it. To give myself a regular goal to shoot for, I started uploading weekly videos to my YouTube channel showcasing what I'd learned every week. These videos quickly took on a life of their own and I got unprecedented opportunities to travel, teach, and perform. I've grown from a hobbyist to an educator in this art that I love and have spent a huge portion of the past seven years spreading that love around the globe. What are the Flow Arts? The Flow Arts are a collection of movement arts that include elements of circus, dance, martial arts, sports, and meditation to create a unique and rapidly growing artform. Usually, this consists of learning how to manipulate one more more props such as Maori poi, hula hoops, staves, juggling clubs, or many more in an aesthetically pleasing way. Practicing this art frequently has meditative benefits for participants and for many the goal of this practice is to attain a state of \"flow\" in which movement becomes effortless and unconsciously guided. Even if flow isn't your goal, however, spinning props is great fun and a wonderful form of exercise! What is my Goal? The Flow Arts is an amazing community for self-empowerment and fulfillment, but our resources haven't kept pace with our meteoric growth in the past few years. We have a wonderfully diverse and passionate group of people to draw on, but frequently the resources they have to draw upon are scattered and incomplete. Over the past 7 years I've learned a lot about educating people on how to spin their props but that only scratches the surface of what we need as flow artists to realize our goals. I want to take knowledge that has been accrued within the community and make it more broadly available to the wider world. I have viewers in countries and places that I'll never be able to visit myself. I'd like to give them the tools that they need to be able to select which tools they want to spin, meet other individuals that share their passion, how to spin safely, learn to dance with their prop, and many many other topics. I want my channel to become an online knowledge base for the Flow Arts world. A place where people come to in order to get the answer to common questions. Help me get there by supporting this effort here on Patreon!"},

I consider myself an artist, storyteller, and role playing enthusiast. I frequently create maps and artwork for my games which I'll be posting here. It's my hope other's can share in the fun and adventure I've created while supporting future work. I don't create CG or animated maps (those can be awesome, but I don't have the tools for that.) Instead, my style focuses on hand-drawn isometric maps. Additionally, I strive to create art that inspires curiosity and imagination. I think maps should be more than just tactical battlefields. Many of my maps often include puzzles, ideas or gameplay mechanics to enhance the game or spark role play opportunities. Storytelling and play is in my blood, but I'm relatively new to TTRPGs. I've run several campaigns over the past three years in D&D 5e, Savage Worlds and Alien. I also have a foundation in art, but map-making is new to me. I value all feedback and would love to hear from you. Did something not work properly in your game? Are there certain adjustments that would work better? Please let me know! I hope to grow and create better maps with each post. Thanks for visiting my Patreon page, and for those who wish to support my work you have my endless gratitude!

We provide various tools and media to help connect and promote LA’s artistic community, including our interactive online map and mobile app, curated event listings, weekly newsletters, coverage of shows, fairs, artist interviews and studio visits, and more. Curate LA has become an indispensable tool for those seeking art experiences and has garnered a deeply engaged community of creatives and culture lovers. L.A. is well known for being difficult to navigate.  Discovering art is particularly elusive for tourists and citizens alike. Finding art and art-related events have typically required some esoteric knowledge. Curate LA solves this problem with the threefold aim of promoting emerging artists, helping everyone experience more art, and fostering growth in the various communities that make up the city’s creative network of art urbs. We highlight a number of different types of art-related events by galleries, museums and artist-run spaces, focusing on a variety of different types of art. We give studio visits to artists and build bridges between them as well as the institutions, galleries and art collectors based in the city, giving everyone a better perspective of the art scene in Los Angeles County. Our platform is essential for artists, curators, art writers, art advisors, designers, architects, journalists, gallery owners, interior decorators, museum directors and other key community members. We revolutionize the way people see art and the way people navigate the city.   The project itself is artist-run and largely driven by community submissions and are a comprehensive resource for culture – something the community has historically lacked. Curate LA is led by a multidisciplinary group of art and media professionals that love Los Angeles and work tirelessly to nurture our world-class creative community.  Join as a supporting member and help us in our mission to promote LA’s artists, galleries and institutions."},

As an artist myself with 20+ years of experience, I've adopted quite a  holistic  approach to being a musician. You can find tutorials on just about any technical aspect of music making but how do you channel creativity, how do you make creative decisions that  make your music and  performances better ? This is where mentoring comes in. Based on your personal situation, I can help you figure out how to find your own voice, your own sound, and how to turn rough ideas to songs, EP’s, albums, even live sets.. I do  group and individual sessions as well as a monthly Q&A with special guests . The program is meant for  every experience level, from beginner to pro .  The program has  three  tiers, with different intensities. The  Group Sessions  are at the core of the program ; Every month I discuss a different subject in a Zoom session with your group, provide resources and ideas, and I’m available by DM or email for feedback and questions. Besides that the groups extensively use a  Slack Channel  to exchange demos and work in progress. For people who are looking for individual guidance, I do  one-on-one sessions  (the Individual Tier, also includes access to Group). There’s limited availability for those, so if you are interested drop me an email first. In the last week of every month I also host a  Q&A Zoom session with special guests . This is the Deeper Dive Tier. In this Tier you also have access to older Q&A’s and archives of ones you missed. I was interviewed recently on the  Holding Hands Podcast with Guava and Desert Sound Colony  about the program and it's quite a good explainer of what I do:   https://soundcloud.com/holdinghandsrecords/holding... I’ve been a music maker, DJ and label owner of 3024 for over 20 years. Recorded solo albums for labels like  Ostgut Ton, Brainfeeder  and  Ninja Tune . I have remixed countless artists including Flying Lotus,  Kode 9 , Maximo Park,  Fever Ray, Goldie  and collaborated with  Four Tet, Inga Copeland  and  Steffi . I'm a resident DJ at Berlin's  Panoramabar  and host a show on London radio station  NTS .   Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have specific questions or needs, I’m more than happy to help. I hope to see you soon! Martyn"},

Or you may have heard him (but didn't know it was him) on Alvinnn and the Chipmunks.  In 2010, Jean left Brockton, Massachusetts to live out his Hollywood dreams. He landed in a little town called Van Nuys and moved into a mustard yellow house with five people from all over the world. They all came to L.A. with a dollar and a dream. That home was on Bassett Street and it was a hub for an array of people who were developing their careers in film, TV, media, and more. One of the roommates created her own talent agency, another is a celebrity hairstylist, and one became a regular on Tyler Perry's show, Love Thy Neighbor. It was a revolving door for a cast of characters, and a house for a family of creatives. With Bassett House Pictures, we invite you to create with others from all walks of life, learn the best ways to accomplish your creative goals, and to work together and support each other.  Right now, we're developing projects and hosting events for creatives and we need your support. We’re on a mission to cultivate an audience that will allow us to create and share our diverse slate of projects and curated short films and pilot presentations. If you'd like to make this happen: CONTRIBUTE! At Bassett House, all the roommates called each other Woomies. So every person who contributes to our cause will become a Woomie as well. Depending on your contribution, you will be sent updates, special invitations, and added to the rolling credits of every project. We have created a monthly subscription – you can invest $5 to $100  – It's up to you. Each tier gives different benefits. Every contribution is appreciated.

I still have a lot of designs that I want to share so I decided to open a Patreon to be able to offer limited edition designs that will be available first for my Patreons and then added in limited amounts to my store. I've decided to open my Patreon as a Sticker Club first and add the Pin Club as a goal that will hopefully be reached soon :) How does this work? This Patreon charges by creation, which means there might not be new rewards every month.

On the deadline date I will post the Paid Post and anyone who has pledged on a reward tier will receive their rewards at the beginning of the next month. Patreon will charge your account the 1st of the month even if the paid post is done in the middle of the month. I will be shipping your rewards at the beginning of the month after a paid post. For example:  May 10th: I'll announce the new rewards and give a deadline to sign up of May 20th May 30th: Last day to sign up for the rewards, paid post goes up June 1st: Patreon charges your account June 7th: June rewards are sent Is shipping included? Yes, but the shipping for stickers and international tier doesn't come with tracking. US enamel pin shipping does have tracking. Will Patrons get to vote on the designs? Yes, I will be taking any Patron suggestions and making polls when it's time for me to design new stickers Are the designs exclusive to Patreon? No, a limited amount will be available in my store after the Patron rewards have been shipped but Patrons will have a discounted price here always. What's the sticker material? The single stickers are printed on glossy vinyl sticker paper that is waterproof. The sticker sheets are matte. What will the Patreon exclusive content be? I will post process videos of how I work on my designs, how I vector my images and how I make patterns. I will share wallpapers every month. Why does this Patreon charge by creation? Because I can't keep up with designing new content every month. This way I can charge only when I have new designs for you!"},

Introduction Hey there, I'm a 3D artist and animator that utilizes Blender to produce animated erotic content involving cute girls from video games and media. My work specializes in POV (but not exclusively) and very intimate experiences, sometimes exploring more diverse routes but still carrying that essence. Patreon and You My content will always be free for everyone to watch, however your support nets you a few humble bonuses as well as helps me produce more animations. There are a few optional tiers for those looking to show further support! As of 2022 I'm now providing VR animations in 6K/4K 60fps as well as standard videos in 4K 60fps, with older content being remastered and re-rendered to meet these new standards over time.  My VR videos are available in 5800x2900 (6K) to 4000x2000 (4K) 60fps in native quality, no image or framerate upscaling.  :) Come on in if you've got a headset to try out and let me know what you think! Where Your Support Goes Hardware & Electricity  - Rendering uses a lot of power, so aside from covering the electricity costs it also helps me set up hardware to produce renders in higher resolutions much faster. Not to mention motion capture, 3d tools, etc. Voice Acting  - I can produce content with more elaborate voice audio thanks to the ability to support a talented voice cast! Longer/Ambitious Animations  - It takes a lot of time out of my day to produce animated content, and plugging other needs will help me look into longer projects and voice talent to fit them! It also lets me invest into tech that can streamline some of this process. Q&A When do you release animations?   For short loops I usually try to aim within a month unless complications arise, longer projects vary due to tuning, render times, sound, etc. Admittedly my workflow isn't very fast and I often miss my own personal deadlines, but I spend a great amount of time polishing to ensure everything is good as can be. How do you decide what character you're going to use?   I like to animate ideas that come to my head but I also listen to a lot of supporter feedback! Do you take commissions?   Not as of writing but keep an eye out! I have a cool animation idea, can I share it?    Drop by my Twitter DMs or my Discord server, I can never guarantee I'll ever do them but I'm always willing to hear out ideas! Do you release the models you use?   For personal reasons usually it's a no. Please don't ask for them unless I choose to release them.   "},

You give such great guidance but don't hold our hands and you foster an environment where we can all give each other honest advice that actually helps. Your challenges have pushed me every time. I've come into some assignments thinking \"how can I possibly do that\" and come out of them with skills I never thought I would have. I only joined in July and I feel like this has changed my life...It's really hard to put into words how much I appreciate what you've done for me. I've had to overcome many obstacles in my life this year including back pain but you've always helped inspire me to to sit up and paint even when I didn't want feel like it. Thank you for this Patreon and experience! It's been amazing!\" -Cardboardbox \"I joined the discord in June 18 with high hopes for my potential improvement, and I am sure satisfy. I learned a lot, especially about things I will not do otherwise for the homework. But with the time passing by, I dropped the ball. And one thing made me come back and wanted to grow more, it’s the people on the discord and see the grow of apprentices from past homework that I missed. You managed to get some nice, kind people on this server, and we are blessed that there is not some troll or anything. The feedback from our critique hour and my peers made me open my eyes on some big holes in my fundamentals, and now I try to stay accountable.\" -Madaoway \"I've been an apprentice for 9 months and I'm really happy. Before this I was a member of an art website that was also $20 / month, and I've made way better progress here than I did there. Tbh I mostly think that the best knowledge is in the public critique hour, and I think a portion of my $20 / month is just supporting that. I do like the way the apprentice thing give us a bit of accountability though, and is forcing us to do stuff that we wouldn't usually do. Plus it's cool to have a small community here. I think it'd be quite cool to see the apprentice stuff tied in more with the main community a bit more, maybe doing the same challenges (sounds like that might happen next month) because it can feel a bit like this community is totally separate. Basically keep up the good work.\" - Jonathan Hobson \"I've been an apprentice since May 2018, 3 months after I started on my art path , 3 months after I discovered Istebrak and her community. I mention this because it was pivotal for me. My 14 day challenge was what really showed me the power of Istebrak's teachings. I had only picked up a pencil once in a blue moon before, to doodle mostly. I knew art was something I really appreciated and wanted to be able to wield at some point but I never thought it could ever be a calling. Istebrak changed that. I am fully dedicated to becoming the best artist I can be. Ok so that was for context. I approached the apprenticeship cautiously. I knew with that many students, it'd be hard to get more personal feedback, which I craved as a complete beginner. I did learn a lot though, through the Patreon streams and the community. I owe you my very first character concept who has now become one of the protagonists for the story my friend and I are working on and my latest \"masterpiece\" would not have been possible without the apprenticeship. Although I do have to dial my Patreon back down for a little while, I never fail to spread the word about Istebrak and her amazing teachings. Thank you for imparting your knowledge with us, I hope you have a healthy and inspired 2019!\" -Tia -I"},

Join the  Brave Joy Collective  for new art & inspiration  in your mailbox every month.  I'm Melanie Weidner, an artist with a passion for beauty and spirituality.  For over 25 years, I've been creating images about the qualities of soul we need for resilience, courage, healing, and joy.  (See  ListenForJoy.com )  Now, I’m offering this Patreon group project: the  Brave Joy Collective  Art Subscription .  Each month, I do a deep dive of prayer and listening for what will challenge and inspire us.  I focus on a particular soulful word or phrase, and use it to make a  brand new piece of art .  Then I write some  spiritual practice ideas  on the theme to help us stay steady, grow our spirits, show up for justice, and find some joy in these challenging and transformative times.  I'll use inclusive language as a welcome to many faiths or spiritual paths.  Imagine us all engaging these monthly intentions together— what a  powerful collective prayer . Of course I keep all this as a  surprise  until it arrives in your mailbox!*   Patreon members are the first to see and hold this fresh art and engage these practices.  Once you subscribe, you receive the next 5x7\" color art print and a spiritual practice text card, mailed on (or very near) the 3rd of each month, delivered by the trusty US Postal system.  Each month after, the new art and practice surprise will arrive.   (US & Canadian addresses only.)* Share the joy by choosing to  receive more identical envelopes to give away .  They’re great for  birthday gifts, good friends, prayer partners, connection across the miles or across town, spiritual gatherings, or as prompts for therapy, social work, spiritual direction, and more .  I mail them to you in your package with an extra envelope, then you just add stamps and addresses for your loved ones. This is so exciting-- and sometimes we want to talk about it.  Most months, I offer a  Brave Joy Zoom Gathering  for story-telling, group reflection, and sometimes mini-retreat workshops.  Members can sign on to Patreon anytime and tell stories in the  comment section .  (Totally optional.)  I post a regular  update about my creative process  or spiritual journey too. I hope each month you’ll find something valuable in your  Brave Joy Collective  envelope.  I trust that on some months it will be exactly what you needed.  :-)  You can always safely unsubscribe too, at any time, for any reason. Your support and connection mean the world to me.  You make this new art work and spiritual practice possible.  And your subscription  supports a monthly social justice donation  too.   Thank you,  thank you . I love listening, creating, and seeing what happens!    Watch your mailbox… and let’s be brave in meaningful ways while we look and listen for joy. Love and blessing to us all, Melanie FAQ Details : * Subscription available for  US and Canadian postal addresses only .  Please register for the correct subscription above.  Canadian subscriptions are only available for the 1 and 2 envelope subscriptions.  Please allow extra delivery time for Canadian postal delivery.   (Forgive me, other international friends while I hope to expand in the future.) • Your Patreon membership subscription will  recur each month  at the price you choose.  Credit cards are charged on the 1st of the month.  Subscription art print envelopes will be mailed out to paying members on or near the 3rd of the month.  You can upgrade or downgrade your membership tier to receive more or fewer envelopes at any time, or safely unsubscribe at any time for any reason.   Please keep track of your log-on information to make any changes to your Patreon account. • Your subscription begins with  whatever art image and practice theme are current the month you sign up .  For example, if you sign up in June, you'll receive the July 3 mailing.  New sign-ups don't include prior mailings.  • Patreon  online weekly updates and commenting  are for members/subscribers only.  • Patreon is  not able to offer gift subscriptions  at this time.  (See the  Gift Subscription mailing-only  version available on my website.)  If you'd like to share images, please subscribe for a tier that includes more than one art print & practice card.  I'll send them to you, and you put on an address and stamp.  Postage for extra envelopes not included. • If you'd like to  order more than 4 envelopes per month , please contact us directly at  [email protected] , thanks. •  Scholarship subscriptions  are available-- please do contact us if that would help, at  [email protected] .  •  Questions?   Write me at  [email protected]  or use the message link above.  Since I'm focused on creating,  please give me a few days to respond .  Thank you!"},

But all over the world, in its most forgotten and despised corners, there are human beings who resist being eaten by the machine and do not give up, do not sell and do not give up. Many colors have, many are their flags, many languages that dress them, and gigantic are their resistance and their rebellion.  El Mandón and its foremen build walls, borders and fences to try to contain that which they say is a bad example. But they cannot do it, because dignity, courage, anger, rebellion, cannot be stopped or locked up. Even if they hide behind their walls, their borders, their fences, their armies and police, their laws and decrees, that rebellion will come to ask them sooner or later. And there will be neither forgiveness nor forgetfulness.” In revolutionary love, solidarity, struggle, and gratitude, Vienna Rye"},

I have a podcast where I chat with remarkable artists from around the world.\n \n \nIf you haven’t heard of my podcast before, here are previous episodes to give you an idea of what the it’s like. \n \n http://www.johndalton.me/podcasts/   (but don’t rush off just yet.) \n \nHere is artwork from some of the artists I’ve chatted with so far on the podcast.\n \n \nBo Bartlett\n \n \nTeresa Oaxaca\n \n \nVincent Desiderio\n \n \nDorian Vallejo\n \n \nRon English\n \n \n \nPretty fantastic right, and that's just a few.\n \n \nHere is what people have been saying about the podcast.\n \n \n “I would just like to add that I think John Dalton is the new Vasari of the New Renaissance!”  \n“One of the best ART broadcasts I've ever listened to.” \n \n\"Quite an enchanting interview that spoke volumes about both interviewer \nand interviewee…  thank you so much for a wonderful hour and a half!\"\n \n\"Wonderful interview!  Thanks John for all the podcasts.\"\n \n\"John’s questions were thoughtful, well pointed and interesting.\nReally enjoyed this conversation! Thanks.\"\n \n\"Excellent, charming and educative interview.\"\n \n \nPretty humbling.\n \n \nThese are long form in-depth conversations.\n \nIt takes me about a day and a half of research in preparation for each podcast. \n \nThe recording takes about another half a day.\n \nAnd then it takes me about a another 2 days to edit the podcast.\n \nSometimes that can blow out to be more . . . like with Vincent Desiderio which took me about five days of research in preparation because Vincent has given so many lectures and interviews\n \nOr the podcast with Candice Bohannon and Julio Reyes which ended up being 3hours long and took about 5 days to edit.\n \nSo there’s a lot of work involved and the Inbetweenisodes take even longer. \n \n Where does Patreon fit in? \nPatreon is a good old fashioned subscription service made new. It comes under the umbrella of ‘crowdfunding,’ but is different from other crowdfunding websites like, Kickstarter and Indiegogo in that with Patreon you commit to a small amount of money regularly - every month. As I said, like a subscription. Patreon was founded by artists themselves which is why I think they, “get it.” A little bit of regular money is, in many ways, better than a big lump of money out of the blue.\n \n \n How much? \nFor as little as the price of a cup of tea every a month you can support the podcast. You can pledge more if you like and you can stop whenever you like.  You can road test how it works if you're scared (you can pull out before you're charged at the end of any month, so it's risk-free.)  \n \n"},

Here you'll find an all-Canadian Magic: the Gathering podcast. We're based on unique, spicy and funny Commander deck building. Come join  #CCONation ! We do all kinds interesting/unique takes on decks and have many ways to be fun and entertaining. In CCONation, all are welcome. On CCOPodcast, you'll hear us talk about building spicy Commander brews, how to spice up boring lists and drinking beer. If that's the kind of Magic the Gathering podcast that sounds appealing to you, look no further that Commander Cookout Podcast! A little about us and the cast We are Ryan and Brando from the beautiful city of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. We know, it's a mouthful. You don't actually have to remember that part. Or be able to pronounce it! Collectively, we have somewhere around 46 years of Magic the Gathering playing experience! Now, we play commander exclusively. That is, if you don't count the MtG drinking games we make up along the way. We started CCOPodcast for a few reasons. First and foremost, because we both love Magic the Gathering. It's become part of who we are and created some of the strongest bonds that people can have in their lives. Second, Brando works in radio and while he isn't currently a radio personality, that's one of his career goals. The podcast acts as an avenue towards that goal. It certainly didn't hurt to have a radio station's recording equipment at our disposal! Our Community Astoundingly to us, we now have, what we call, a world wide Audience! As mentioned before, that audience has come to be known and  #CCONation . The majority of our listenership resides in the USA and Canada but  the top 10 countries in  #CCONation  after that are Brazil, The United Kingdon, Australia, Philippines, Germany, Belgium, Italy, The Netherlands, Mexico and France! Holy crap, that's awesome! Shout out to all other nations who tune in every week! What makes CCOPodcast Unique? A couple things actually. For one, we're normal dudes. Dudes that you might want to actually hang out with, chill drink some beer and jam games! We do Arcs of episodes. Like mini-seasons. A few episodes in a row on a common topic to get as much coverage as we can. Along with each new Arc comes a giveaway! You can enter for free too! Tune in to find out how. Also, with the help of  EDHREC.com , we've come up with both the Spice Calculator. To find out more about that, visit  CommanderCookout.com Thanks for checking us out!"},

Because art history, like everything, is all about the story. I started  The Lonely Palette   with the goal of telling these stories , one painting, sculpture, exhibition, and urinal at a time.   Using the object as a jumping-off point, we've dived together into the significance, history, and social context of artists and movements, and they've been, I hope, as neat, accessible, and compelling to you as they are to me.   Think of the adventures we've had together!  Remember when we made  abstraction a little less terrifying ?  And  Degas' Aunt Fanny a little less boring ?  Remember when we  compared Monet canvases to Lay's potato chips , and explained exactly  why Nazi art was so sucky ?  We've dived headfirst into  art history's woman problem , and  cavorted with Futurist douchebags .  And all without leaving the comfort of your earbuds! Here's the thing, though.   The lonely\npart is no joke :   The Lonely Palette  is\njust me.  I research, write,\nproduce, host, and edit the whole shebang, and believe me when I tell you that\nit’s the best part of my week.  But even\na labor of love is labor, and ask Van Gogh how only selling one painting in his\nlifetime worked out for him. This is where you come in!   You can bring  The Lonely Palette  to the masses, one patron at a time.  And donating\neven just a few dollars an episode\nmeans that I can...  Upgrade my recording gear... Pay for vocal booths... ...and, most\nimportantly, take the show on the road to museums across the country\nand around the world, sending you postcards all along the way.   FAQ:   I'm new to Patreon.  So I just give once and get my mug, right? Nope!  You're a full-blown patron of the arts, like a modern day Lorenzo di Medici, supporting Michelangelo on a continual basis in exchange for art, except this is even better than a marble tomb, because you get swag, too!  In short,  you pay this amount every time I release an episode , which I hope you believe to be a worthy cause. Whoa whoa whoa.  How often do you release an episode? My goal is to release 12 episodes (ideally) per year, 10 at a minimum.  I don't charge patrons for re-releases or special episodes (live recordings, etc.), only when I put pen to paper and mic to face.  So it's equivalent-ish to  monthly support  - for every month I release two episodes, you'll find me on my fainting couch taking a month off.  Don't forget, too, that you can set a monthly limit for how much you can give. I want to give, but I'm broke, and a $1 per episode seems lame and/or insulting.  So I just won't do anything.  Bye. No no no!  Come back!  No amount is too little , BELIEVE ME.   Every little bit counts , and is so very much appreciated. I love the show, but I just can't support you anymore, or at the level I signed up at.  Am I a monster if I abandon this? No, not at all.  This is 100% voluntary.  Please just do me a favor before you go: leave a rating/review on iTunes, post about the show on social media, and tell one new person face-to-face.   Word of mouth  is still the best (and only) way to spread the news about podcasts, and it would help me out enormously. *** So go ahead.  Channel your inner Medici.  Consider becoming a patron of  The Lonely Palette .   And   thank you , from the bottom of my heart, for supporting, for listening, and for giving me the opportunity to see art through your eyes so you can look with your ears. - Tamar"},

The show is meant to be a celebration of the music; no distractions. Making that choice means that NR cannot monetize the show for us. That's why we're here! If you wish to support Scot and Jeff in their efforts on  Political Beats , this is the chance to do it.  After three years and 85+ episodes,  Political Beats  now is offering our fans a chance to vote on upcoming episodes, grab high-quality audio files, and get access to exclusive episodes produced by Scot and Jeff. We're proud of the work that has gone into these shows and always strive to provide an episode that is worthy of the music that has inspired and entertained so many of us.

Yup, I am involved in two big comic projects. The first is Bean, I am still coloring and adding to that book and I am excited with the progress. The second, if you have not seen the updates is that I am drawing a daily comic called Life of the Party.  Life of the Party is a daily fun comic strip about the pros and cons of adventuring in a fantasy world. It has been going on for more than a year and it is getting bigger and bigger.  I will continue to update the look and feel of this project as well. I will be adding new exciting rewards and interacting more with those that support. One addition will be  downloadable content for gaming, including custom maps, character  npc, etc. I want people to enjoy the adventure. (more information will be coming in the next month Am I stopping the Bean?  Nope- I am still dedicated to coloring that incredible story . What is Life of the Party?  Life for the party is a online comic about the realities of adventuring from a characters point of view.  It's fun and full of humor and it's audience is growing.  So Who am I? My name is  Travis Hanson  and I create graphic novels original artwork, and fantasy prints that stretch the imagination and encourage people to follow their dreams. Over the last 6 years I have worked on a webcomic series called  \"The Bean\"  (over 750 pages and growing) as well as a daily comic strip called  Life of the Party -.(almost 300 pages)  The Passion to create and the reality -  This has been a labor of love for many years. Unfortunately, it has been a hobby and I have not been able to focus on more than one page a week. There are bills to be paid and mouths to be fed. Yet I still believe in the dream and even in the tough times, I have always updated and given Bean's story to the world for free, as well as the comic Life of the Party. I want to finish Bean's story and have it be read and loved. I want people to be able to imagine themselves there with Bean in his adventures in full color, just how I first envisioned it. A full color epic story about the transformation of a young boy into someone more than he ever imagined himself to be.   So why am I here on Patreon? . As the campaign grows, I will be able to dedicate more time to finish  \"The Bean\"  books and go back and produce color versions that will\n inspire and delight the readers. I will also continue to offer a daily comic about adventuring in the form of  \"Life of the Party.\"  Your part in this journey, starts \nwith the first step to become involved with Patreon.  You can help make a\n difference in this project with your generous support.  I am committed to telling the stories of inspiration and hope, \nillustrating them with imaginative artwork, and helping people to find \ntheir own happiness and joy through service and imagination.   What and When are the updates? Life of the Party Updates: There will be a Life of the Party update every single day. I am giving this comic away for free. The rewards will begin to match the RPG gaming world- including npc's, new monsters and Maps.  The Bean Updates:  With the help of flattener Darne Lang, we will update the color pages from the beginning of Book 1 once a week.  The more money that is contributed, the more pages will be completed. My ultimate goal would be to update Bean's story in Full Color 5 times a week. Bean and Life of the Party will always be free to read online, but to those special people who become patrons, in addition to helping complete this project, will also have special access to special contests (free art) and opportunities to comment, chat and be the first to preview the story pages before everyone else get to see them. Your feedback, as a patron of the arts, is very important to me and many times the story has incorporated\n the ideas that you have shared with me.  As you contribute, there will \nbe opportunities for you to be able to receive a copy of each new book \nas it is printed, depending on your level of contribution. Thank you so much for your support in Bean's story over the years. I have appreciated that you have shared his story, contributed to the funding and strengthened\n me to keep moving forward. I am very excited to finally be able to see \nBean move in such a positive and incredible direction. I could never \nhave come this far without your help, your encouragement, your financial support, and your belief in the power of changing the world through following your dreams.  I promise to continue to make this adventure of a humble dishwasher an incredible ride.  Please\n commit your financial support today to keep this dream alive.  As \nlittle as one dollar can get you started as a Patron of the Arts.    Keep creating, keep dreaming and keep believing.  Travis Hanson"},

My work is theatrical, funny and deep. I  founded The Secret City in NYC in 2007 as a way to celebrate art and to provide community for artists. The driving beliefs behind The Secret City are: art is sacred and crucial to survival. And, everything is possible through community. We’ve been putting on big, live, colorful spectacles in NYC, LA and the Hudson Valley for over twelve years. Since the covid-19 crisis, our programming is a live daily show on our  Facebook  and  Instagram  page.  Daily Artistic Inspiration for Troubled Times, with Chris Wells , everyday except Sunday at 9am pt/12pm et. It’s been an incredible experience with people from all over in search of community, connection and inspiration.  Pledging to us means you're building sustainability, creating community and promoting the arts. You become an active, engaged member of our community. You’ll also get cute perks and incentives, including exclusive content and online gatherings. We’re in the midst of overhauling this page and will roll out new levels/incentives the first week of May. Stay tuned. WHAT IS THE SECRET CITY? The Secret City is an Obie Award-winning arts organization that presents sincere and fabulous community celebrations of everyday creative life. We're inclusive, colorful and joyful. Our work extols the creative spirit in every one of us, and softens bigotry, hatred, and intolerance.  Here are some recent responses to our live events:  \"Finally, something worth worshiping! A communal, spiritual, art-fest without the g-o-d talk. From a neo-pagan, dionysian, tantric, taoist, atheist, sacred humanist…thank you for creating something worthy of the 21st century.” \"All I can say is O.M.G.\" 'Another beautiful event - great way to start the week.\" \"Wow. That was a revelation, a celebration, and an inspiration. Thank every performer, artist, poet, musician, dancer, musician, and trickster who contributed!\" \n \n How Can You Help?   Pledge and invite others to join you.  Your membership helps The Secret City be sustainable and grow. When you give to us, you're pledging to be a part of the magic we create. This money will go to producing our annual season showcasing phenomenal, relevant artists in today's world. Our events help people make, create, and strengthen their connections to each other, to the community, and to the world.  \n \nIn addition to giving, we really hope you'll help us spread the word - to your friends, family, on  Facebook  and  Twitter .  Consistent, monthly giving makes all the difference for The Secret City! \n"},

But Patreon offers\nthat infrastructure, and as a result projects that might not otherwise be\nfeasible for me are suddenly in the realm of possibility. \n \n\nIn addition to the books\n(usually about history), I like to make paper figure sets for display or gaming,\npapercraft dioramas,  portraits of\nhistorical figures with accompanying mini-biographies, posters, and essays about\nthe craft of comic-making. \n \n\nI’m proud of this extraneous\nwork.  I enjoy doing it.  It sharpens my skills, leading to better\nbooks.  It allows me to dip my toe in a\ngiven research pool and do a project about, say, Mountain Men in the 1830s or Mamelukes\nin the 1500s without having to commit to a book about them at the expense of\nsomething with richer narrative possibilities. \nAnd, most of all, it’s a way to share something that excites me a great\ndeal with others.  Whether that be\ncharacters from a book I hold dear to my heart (like  The Three Musketeers  or  Harry Potter  or  The Thousand Autumns of Jacob De Zoet ) or historical figures\nwhose exploits are less well-known than they might be (like  black adventurers  or  warrior women of renown ), or an aspect of comics-making that I find\nparticularly important ( avoiding tangents ), I’ve found that it not only\nenriches my life to make these but it has the chance to enrich the lives of\nother folk, as well.  If I can share an\naspect of history that gets someone excited about history, or share  a research experience  that prompts someone else to take the same trek, or wax about a book\nand give someone else that nudge that will convince them to enjoy it, too,\nwell, that’s about the most I could hope to do from a drawing desk, and it’s an\nopportunity that I welcome. \n \n\nYour support will allow me to\nspend more time on projects like this rather than taking on freelance work to\nhelp pay the bills, and allow me to share those projects with whoever might\nfind them to their liking.

In the past I often got asked how I built my bases. This is the place where you find the answers. \n The focus on my Patreon Page is 2:1 Bases to Miniature Painting Tutorials.  \n Currently there are around 40-50 Tutorials available.  \nEach Tutorial is a PDF-Document with between 25 and 59 pages. \n I remove some of my old Tutorials from time to time.

This New STL Pledge is 6$ only for the STLs of that month. Or option 12$ with access to all Tutorials aswell.  I think this is a great opportunity to create specific models for dioramas.

The pledges help me invest in new models and allow me to work with sculptors from all over the world. Oliver will still focus on the miniature, diorama building and the 3D printing.

Well, I decided to go for it, and document it all so one day a kid just like me could get a different message. That message is... \"Don't just follow your dreams.  Run them down with everything you've got!  As far as anyone knows we only get one chance at this life and no one is going to hand you the life you want so go for it, and never give up!\" Back in 2013, I sold my home, packed up my little family, and moved to a part of the world where I didn't even speak the language.  I'm building a new life here from scratch, and I'm in way way over my head. I almost stopped documenting my life/projects/philosophy so I could focus completely on the task at hand. I was amazed at the number of people who encouraged me to keep going.  Somehow without really knowing it the original idea behind the documentation was working.  Now you guys are telling me that I don't have to do it alone.  ...that all I have to do is ask for help.  Its a difficult thing for me.  ...asking for help. Please help.  In all honesty I'm already committed to the life I'm creating here regardless of how difficult it gets.  I'm currently paying $55 per month on fast internet on a secluded island so I can upload videos regularly, and in HD.  ...which I haven't historically done.  I'm on a shoestring budget working with 1 camera sent to me by a person I've never met (Thanks so much) and using a computer that someone else sent me (thanks so much for that, too).   Now I have no mailing address... being on a tiny island in the ocean.  I'll keep documenting things as long as I reasonably can.  If you guys can cover the internet I'll keep posting.  With a little more I can hold off longer before I have to get a job doing something less interesting.  Anything over basic survival funds will go directly into the projects I do, and I'll do my best to share that with everyone in a useful/entertaining way.  ...and if someone sends like a million dollars or a pile of building materials I'll totally build a walking fortress science school.  ;-)  ...no, seriously.  ...I might be doing it anyway. I don't pretend to have all the answers, but I do know that I have a pile of e-mails from people telling me that my videos have made a positive difference in their lives.  Help me keep going because there's some kid out there right now who just needs a little nudge from some lunatic on the internet who says crazy things like \"You can do anything!\", and \"Never give up!\" Thanks for everyone's support through all my ups and downs... emotional, financial, helpful items, and most of all thanks for doing everything you can to make the world awesome.

Whoever you are, Citius Mag is making stuff that you'll find relatable, insightful, and maybe a little bit funny. This is our third year on the world wide web, and we have some big plans for new and exciting stuff. Your support will help us get there! Our readers, followers, listeners and fans have spoken. We're irreverent, clever, arbitrarily ritualistic but fundamentally beholden to the principles set forth in the book 'Once a Runner' and followed by any of us who’ve given running an honest shot. The site is spearheaded by Chris Chavez. If you've enjoyed any of our work in recent years, we ask you to please consider donating any dollar amount so that we can continue creating more content for the running community. For a little bit of background, most of the CITIUS MAG team works full-time jobs. This has been a passion project that we've developed over the years and because people are enjoying it, we've kept it going. A daily routine tends to include a full 9-5 workday, a run in the evening, dinner and then a late-night editing session of audio or writing to post on the site and keep our audience satisfied. It's a labor or love but you keep us going.  Please keep us going. If you're interested in a larger-scale sponsorship of the podcasts or site, please reach out to Chris Chavez at  [email protected] If you've been wondering where some of the money has gone toward: We sent a team of writers to the Prefontaine Classic, Berlin Marathon, U.S. Outdoor Championships and New York City Marathon in 2018. In 2019, we traveled out to the Boston Marathon, Chicago Marathon, Western States and Berlin Marathon. In 2020, we had a team cover the U.S. Olympic Marathon Trials in Atlanta and then made a movie out of it.  We've been able to upgrade our podcast equipment to produce higher quality shows on the CITIUS MAG Podcast, Runners of NYC, Showrunners with Scott Fauble and More than Running with Dana Giordano feeds. Your help has also helped cover hosting expenses for the website and podcasts, which can stack up quickly."},

Thank you for visiting. Patreon: What & Why? Patreon is a membership platform for creators. Patrons allow for my artistic process to be open, emerging, and expansive. I want my creative work to live less in a realm of transaction (set fees, hourly rates, scarcity) and more in transformation (flow, gift, service, adaptation, abundance). For me, too much transaction crowds and hurts just about everything and everyone I see or touch or love. I want to create a different story for  how I love, give, serve, show up, and make art.  What is Intrinsic Paths? A creative \"walking artist\" journey focused on deepening and widening personal and collective relationships to one another, to one's inner life, and to the natural world. You Might Become a Patron if you... (A) have been nourished by my creative work and want to see/inspire more (B) want to go deeper and make a more intentional connection (C) would benefit from receiving various video reflections, walking/movement meditations, walking/movement practices, poetry, art pieces, 25% off all art and jewelry in Intrinsic Paths shop, and more (see projects below). (D) want to support events and programming alongside my new book, WALK - Slow Down, Wake Up & Connect at 1-3 Miles per Hour. Welcome Statement: Beloveds of all backgrounds regardless of age, ability, race, class, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, ethnicity, country of origin, political affiliation, and religious tradition are so beyond welcome to become a Patron. All references to walking are inclusive of moving by wheelchair or powered stroller. Your Patronage Supports: Materials, tools, creative strategy/time, content development, movement building partners, fees, food, bus passes, shelter/rent, and ALL that keeps my body healthy and thriving. *** No strings  attached. No hard feelings  for starting, re-arranging, and stopping  as a Patron. None. Ever. Freedom, peace, and dignity for all. *** Current Projects: 1. Walking Invitation, Pedestrian Dignity & WALK Book Tour (1)  Walking Invitation  includes contemplative, long-distance, and human dignity-themed programming, custom walking routes, and artmaking.  Pedestrian Dignity  is a storytelling initiative using video, photo, audio, and experiential documentation (over 80K followers on TikTok!) of built environments that unapologetically centers all who walk, roll and use transit for transportation, health, and the planet. WALK - Slow Down, Wake Up & Connect at 1-3 Miles Per Hour Inclusive Stories & Practices North Atlantic Books WALK book is out now and can be found wherever books are sold. Check out upcoming dates and events alongside the  WALK book tour here . 2. Bold Love Revolving content (with humility and imperfection) on issues of class, race, LGBTQIA2S+, religion, politics, cooperative economics, reparations, colonization, money, Earth care, consumerism, and more. Opening our hearts. Waking up. Healing our pain. Going deeper. If you are me... And I am you... What must we do... Who must we be... 3. Artwork Most days I am carrying around a large sketchbook in my backpack. I love simple ink pen work and crave to spend more time in the years ahead creating and gifting ink art pieces. I also love to wander and collect unique earth stones, fallen juniper pieces, and seashells for n ecklaces, altars, and mixed media art pieces. Learn more about my artwork by visiting the  Intrinsic Paths shop  and keeping an eye on social media for upcoming art markets in Colorado. All Patrons receive 25% off anything in the shop, always! 4. Engaged Contemplation Guided (virtual and in-person) meditation, walking meditation, and nature/body/breathing-based practice. Honoring many forms, teachers, traditions, and rituals. Always with imperfection, humility, and vulnerability. \"...the Earth will be safe  when we feel safe in ourselves.\" ~ Thich Nhat Hanh 5. Movement Weaving Protected time creating alongside inspiring individuals and grassroots initiatives that tug on my heart and inspire a more loving, connected, and just world. See some of the Movement Weaving organizations supported by Patrons  here . *** My Brief Story: In 2010, I spent 242 days walking across the United States and have continued to walk alongside thousands of people for thousands of miles. I'm a passionate \"Walking Artist\", social entrepreneur (co-ops!), and advocate for racial, social, and economic justice. I'm also LGBTQIA+, Creator of  Intrinsic Paths  (+ Pedestrian Dignity), and Founder of  Walk2Connect . I am the author of  WALK - Slow Down, Wake Up, & Connect at 1-3 Miles Per Hour  with North Atlantic Books. I also finished my studies at the Living School for Action and Contemplation in 2017 and have committed my life to help people deepen and heal their relationship with one another, the natural world, and themselves. *** #godeeper #loveharder"},

I graduated from an Ivy League university in the US, and obtained two master degrees, including an MBA. I worked as a Private Wealth Manager for a Wall Street firm and as a Private Banker, where I learned that reality in the financial world is the opposite of theory learned in academic environments. Unfortunately, I also learned that ethics and morality are severely lacking in this industry as well, and my disenchantment with the low utility of my academic career at some of the top institutions in the world combined with my disillusionment with the corporate finance industry launched my entrepreneurial career. I’m excited to tell you more about the skwealthacademy community that is helping me move forward in my vision of revolutionizing the education system to make critical thinking skills and application of knowledge in the real world, two aspects astonishingly absent in most traditional forums of schooling today, the backbone of any educational institution that wants to attract intellectually curious students. As someone that achieved national university entrance exam scores in the top 1% of the nation and that graduated from an ivy league university, I often incorrectly correlated these academic achievements to intelligence due to the naivete of youth. \n \nHowever, the more I researched the history of academics, the more I learned about the focus of academics on tasks that have low correlation to intellectual development, \n such as rote memorization of facts and the administration of an exam based system   that often tests for low intellectual abilities like superficial problem solving and the regurgitation of information without any demonstrated ability to understand complex concepts and the applicability of these concepts to improve one’s quality of life in the real world. In other words, most exam systems administered in classrooms all over the world fuel competition among students for high-grades, that even if achieved, predominantly fail to develop intellect and real-world skills. \n \nFor this reason, while attending the University of Pennsylvania, I often met students at fellow Ivy League schools that possessed near perfect GPAs but demonstrated a near complete absence of critical thinking skills, while I often met students with far lower GPAs that exhibited far greater intellect. Because our global academic system lauds students as brilliant without imparting any deep critical thinking skills to them, my mission at skwealthacademy is to correct this massive failure of the system, and one that I intend to correct. I have already completed writing materials for all 19 courses and nearly 80 accompanying exercises, appropriate for everyone between the ages of 6 and 106, and I am now in the process of proofing all materials and recording all materials in audio/visual format. After I launch skwealthacademy, it is my wish to provide some truly exciting additional opportunities for skwealthacademy members all around the world to connect with one another all and to perhaps even use these new networks to launch their own entrepreneurial pursuits, so stay tuned! \n \nTogether, let’s return the focus of academics on the development of critical thinking skills that translate to the real world and steer it away from the pursuit of meaningless high grades. In doing so, we will instill in our communities the indelible values of cooperation, camaraderie and goodwill among all of humanity.\n \nI look forward to staying connected and have a blessed day!\n \nBlessings,\n \nJohn Kim CEO &\nFounder  skwealthacademy \n"},

Now it’s our time to connect more and more women together who are just like us and build a strong platform.  We are dedicated to organizing and mobilizing the movement for women’s liberation, and ultimately for socialism. In 2016, the Party for Socialism and Liberation began producing the magazine.  Breaking the Chains  is a one-of-its-kind feminist, socialist magazine, deeply connected to the everyday experiences of working women from generations past to today. The magazine intervenes in the political landscape at a time when we desperately need a new militant women’s movement. The creators, who edit, write, design, draw and produce the magazine, are women workers and activists in our communities. We believe that capitalism is the basis for the oppression of women and socialism is a necessary step to overturn that oppression.  We need your help.  Become a patron today.  Help make Breaking the Chains a successful project that can reach women across the country. Not a single creator on this project receives an income from the work.

I could stay in touch with all of you and give you a glimpse of the 'behind -the- scenes' of my personal life.  \n\n Slowly my creative focus shifted more towards other social media platforms such as Instagram, Youtube. Besides that my career as a portrait photographer started to take off. I created cover songs together with Oliver, with matching videos that you can all find on my  Youtube Channel .  I was touring with EPICA, being a mother, running my photography business, the blog and and and…. a lot more ;) Some things that started as a passion have become a profession and in order to approach my art professionally, I could use your help. I have so many creative ideas that I would like to dive into musically and visually. With your help, I will be able to create more and at a much higher level.   It is time for me to explore the world of Patreon. A place where I can create to my hearts desire; that could be cover songs, music videos, anything photography- related, blogging and so much more! I guess the sky is the limit. I would like to see if this is a good fit for you and me. Through Patreon, I will be able to work together with my  favourite musicians, producers, photographers, videographers, graphic designers and other talented artists .  If you want to be the first to hear my music, watch my videos with all the juicy behind the scenes, then you have come the right place! \n\n So what can you expect?  \n\n On Patreon, I will be focusing on  creating music , my  photography  projects and  blogposts You will have access to: Exclusive Content  that you can only find here Music - You will hear it first  (some of it exclusively) \n Videos - You will see it first  (some of it exclusively) Behind the scenes material including bloopers haha! \n Photography - Download hi-res  versions of my photographs and self portraits \n Blogposts   - you will r ead it first.  My blog  www.smoonstyle.com  will remain solely a beauty/fashion blog. \n Hang Outs ; talking, singing, even cooking maybe?  Please have a look a the different memberships that I created and see if there is something that you like and come join the family!  \nI welcome you with open arms and can’t wait to get this creative party started here on Patreon. Love, Simone"},

Despite not having had any formal training in art, that hasn't stopped me from pursuing my personal art goals. What I'd like is for this to be a place where I can share my full resolution images, unfinished and finished sketches, previews (WIPs) of upcoming drawings and longer better resolution time-lapses of the pieces that I regularly post online. On top of that, I'd also be open to hearing what you guys would like to see from me too. I will also be attempting to livestream in the future as well, so stay tuned for that! I'm hoping that with your help, I'll get more freedom to spend time on personal art pieces, as well as being able to dedicate myself to developing my own projects. This would also be a chance for plenty of experimenting. So, if that sounds like something you'd like to support, then I'll give you my thanks!

First a little about me:  My name is Jason Rodgers. I'm the creative artist behind  Fez-o-rama . I've studied theater, costuming, have a degree in fashion design; self-taught in graphic arts, embroidery design, and many forms of crafting. I have taught Photoshop, Illustrator, and Computer Patternmaking for Fashion Design in Los Angeles for 13 years. While I was teaching I decided to turn my hobby of making embroidered velvet fezzes for my friends into something more. Over the years this went from a running gag, to a weekend hobby, and eventually into the business that is Fez-o-rama. I am continuously thrilled and amazed that something so ridiculous as designer velvet fezzes would find the audience and support needed to become the full-time jobs for both myself and my wife Maya as we continue to make every fez ourselves in our home studio. I am very proud of what we have accomplished, but there is a problem. The one thing I love more than making my art, is learning  new skills  to make  new stuff  and sharing that with others. Working for yourself tends to eat up a lot of time and it is easy to lose track of your passions. My goal with this Patreon page is to create a close knit community to share, collaborate, learn, and inspire. I've done a lot creative projects to support Fez-o-rama, such as custom booths, lighting displays, and travel cases. I get a lot of questions about these projects but documenting the process gets lost in all of the fezzes we have to make. I would love to be able to not only share those past projects so others can build upon them, but also share the journey as I take on new challenges. By becoming a Patron you will get to see works in progress in photos, videos and reports, and peek behind the curtain of our \"con life\" with travelogues as we venture out to shows. Going forward you will even get input on future projects as I take on new challenges and learn new skills all the while sharing tips, techniques, and resources. Ultimately you will get the opportunity to participate in group learning projects and get access to special edition items and prototypes. As this community grows and evolves, I will be able to learn new things and be able to make cool new stuff to share with you."},

(I even wrote a book about it:  \"Lightsurfing: Living Life in the Front of My Mouth\" ,  an anecdotal, autobiographical journey of what it takes to carve your own path in the world. It's got cool pictures if you don't feel like reading. And if you like even more cool pictures,   I make a LOT of them . \n\n But that sparkling whirlwind, working with thousands of festival-goers in every flavor of weather, driving for a week, and sleeping in the back of my car, has taken its toll. The business brain is diametrically opposed to the brain that births these visions and stories into the world. It is my hope that you, beloved patron, will help me do what I was put on\nthe planet to do!"},

Amanda Knox  and  Christopher Robinson  here. First off, we have to say: There are so many causes, organizations, and creators you could support — we're big fans of the  Washington Innocence Project — so the fact that you'd consider supporting our work is humbling. We don't expect it, nor do we take it for granted. Who are we? You probably know that Amanda spent nearly four years in an Italian prison and eight years on trial for a murder she didn’t commit. In that time, Christopher was trapped in grad school, and publishing novels like  War of the Encylopaedists , which the  New York Times  called \"captivating,\" and  Deliver Us , a Foreword Indies Book of the Year finalist.  And we've been busy the last few years! Amanda published a memoir called   Waiting to Be Heard , hosted   The Scarlet Letter Reports , a series about the public vilification of women, and we jointly wrote and produced  The Truth About True Crime , a podcast and  Facebook Watch series . We've also delved deep into criminal justice reform at  www.crimestory.com . We published our first joint book,  The Cardio Tesseract , a collection of love poems, in February, 2020. And we've done some silly things like  this short film  for the 48 Hour Film Festival. Most of our creative output is available for FREE, including the project we've poured our hearts and brains into the last few years, our podcast  Labyrinths .  We'd had exciting guests like  Malcolm Gladwell,   Jon Ronson ,  Dave Navarro ,  Michael Pollan ,  Sam Harris , and  LeVar Burton , among others, we've gotten wildly intimate in our miniseries about infertility and pregnancy, and we've opened our minds with psychedelic mushrooms! But that's just the tip of the iceberg! We're also working on a documentary, writing a book, and developing several secret and exciting projects, hoping it all doesn't collapse under our feet!  Your support is the difference between us  PLAYING IT SAFE,  pursuing only those opportunities that we KNOW will pay the bills, and us  TAKING RISKS,  wading into new territory, while bringing nuance, compassion and delight to everything we produce. If you choose to support us, not only will you get a window into our creative madness through exclusive patron only benefits, but you'll enable us to be our boldest, most creative selves.  Thank you so, so much! Amanda + Christopher P.S. Please note, Patreon charges on the day you sign up, granting you access to our entire back-catalog of posts, and then moving forward, you'll be charged on the first of each month. If you sign up a few days before the end of the month, you'll be charged again very shortly after. Let us know and we can refund the double charge. You can also sign up for an annual membership and get a 10% discount!  "},

In that time period, regular facility donations made a critical jump thus helping to secure the home of the animals I love - something of which I'm very proud to have aided.  I don't get paid by the facility but I do try to monetize my more \"me-centric\" online endeavors via ads, merchandise, etc. with the long-term goal of making a standalone living as an online content creator. I'm using my Patreon page as a subscription service. I'm not a starving artist, and I'm not asking for people to subsidize my existence so that my creativity can \"blossom and flourish\". I wish to merely provide my patrons with entertaining content of value - something, to them, that is worth the price of admission. That's it.  If you would rather utilize your money to support the CARE facility, then by all means please do so - attracting supporters to CARE is the reason I started making content online in the first place!  The animals of CARE have a fantastic home and you can be a part of preserving that home (Don't worry, I'll be perfectly fine if that's the route you choose to take ^_^)  Donate to CARE"},

Liz here, and welcome to my Patreon! \n \n \n What is Patreon? \nPatreon is a way for fans to support creators who's work they enjoy, so that these creators than continue to do what they do. It's a purely voluntary patronage, where you decide exactly how much you want to contribute towards your favorite artists, writers, musicians, and entertainers.\n \n \n Why I'm using Patreon \nPatreon will give me the flexibility and freedom to dedicate far more of my time towards the creative pursuits I enjoy - Art, comics, making videos, and more - and share them with you guys in a way that allows for the least amount of hiding-behind-paywalls as possible.  My interests vary, but at the core of what I want is to entertain folks; as cheesy as it sounds, nothing makes me feel better than knowing someone got a laugh or a smile out of something I did, whether it be a silly comic, an illustration, a journal post, or a video of me derping around in a videogame.  It's patrons like YOU that help keep me afloat so I can focus on creating more and better stuff for all of you. :)\n \n \n How does it work? \nPatreon is 100% an optional service, based around a pay-what-you-want subscription model. For those that do choose to contribute, I will be sharing occasional goodies with my patrons, whether that be early access art, behind the scenes videos, work-in-progress drawings and photos, blog posts from my travels, plus some occasional freebies. If you enjoy my work and want to help me create more in the future, consider becoming a patron and get some awesome goodies!  \n \n What is your Patronage funding? Glad you asked! :D You can check out my work at the following places: MY WEBSITE: Lizardbeth.Art LizardbethArt @ Instagram Lizardbeth (@lizurdbef_art) TikTok ...and for general unfiltered nonsense,  follow me on   Twitter! \n \n\n \n\t Thank you so much for checking out my Patreon! \n\t \n\tMake sure you check out & bookmark my main website at \n\t Lizardbeth.Art! \n"},

Weekly podcasts dive into tactics from guys with proven track records of taking mature animals on public land across the southern states and cover hard topics such as hunting pines, hunting cutovers, locating a bucks core area, finding pinch points and funnels in areas where they are hard to identify, how bucks bed in the south, how to map scout deer and turkeys, and so much more that we cant fit in this description.  On the video side of things, we film our hunts so you can see the tactics talked about on the podcast put into action. We strive to show the process of how a deer hunt goes down, and we show the mistakes that teach us how to find success. We also produce un-biased hunting gear reviews on a regular basis, evaluating products from the southern, mobile public land hunter perspective. "},

On New Years Day, 2022, for example, I recorded a full album from start to finish and give it to ALL PATRONS on ALL LEVELS. An album of archived material showed up in your inbox nearly every month in 2022...including the TOUGH SAILORS LP, also recorded in one day on New Years Day way back when in Joshua Tree. All of these posts are yours when you subscribe to this page.   I used to travel the planet and play shows in order to earn the money to pay my bills and make more art. That has all changed in recent times, and the touring has slowed down considerably! This means I get to spend lots of quality time with my daughter, which I am very grateful for. In 2019 I played 120 shows. In 2020 I had 60 on the books, but all of that changed. 2021 was reasonable but I did get to go to Alaska and Denmark, and a mini West Coast run with Todd Snider. I have no manager, but I do have a booking agent. I am fairly independent in regards to the music business. I still long to play house concerts, and if you want to have one or know somebody that wants to have one, I am all about it.   In February, 2022, I unearthed three totes full of archival CDs and other material. Out takes, rarities, 4-track demos made in hotel rooms across America, unreleased songs, B-sides, and tons & tons of live shows. If you join me here, you will receive songs that nobody else gets. There are more than a few albums of material waiting for you in the older posts, and I have been fairly consistent with posting something new to Patreon every few weeks.   This Patreon platform is here to gather those friends and fans who believe in what I do and want to see me do more of it, unfettered, unfiltered, and with joy. I am asking you to join me as I chop down creative barriers with words, songs, and the unharnessed production of art. I wish to maintain complete independence in with my music and writing. Subscribing on Patreon is a way to cut out the filter that is between the creator and those that consume art. The first tier of being a Patron is quite reasonable. Two bucks a month and you get a song EXCLUSIVE TO PATRONS every month. That's a 12 song album at the end of the year that ONLY PATRONS HAVE. Also, you get the bonus albums that I drop each month such as demo collections from the past and the New Years Day 2022 \"Busker\" album. The monthly new songs are fully fleshed out demos for my commercial releases, filmed on video, with me playing all the instruments and having fun in general. I love to do this and having this platform to share it with you will help keep me focused. You get to see how I build the house, so to speak, and how the construction changes by the time the album is on the streets, which you also get before anybody else.  Projects on the horizon are plentiful. My next commercial album has basically been written, and all the demos are in the past posts that you get to unlock when you join us here. You will be getting the demos for new songs, but many are waiting in my monthly posts throughout the last two years. There will be videos and painted vinyl jackets to accompany this batch of tunes.For a creative workaholic such as myself, I thank you listeners for your appreciation. By becoming a Patreon supporter, you will assist my day to day abilities to get the work done. My aim was to tour less (well, that dream was fulfilled thanks to the pandemic)  and create more in proximity to Nashville and my family, and to do environmental and educational projects such as the FIFTY RIVERS PROJECT where my daughter is part of the journey.  Okay....thanks for contemplating and I will see you around the neighborhood.  There are A LOT of songs waiting for you to DOWNLOAD once you become a Patron, and you can write me anytime and ask me a question.    Tim E. in Tennessee"},

Not being a gamer, myself, I moved on as an actor and, as the years went by, pretty much forgot about it.  That all changed in 2021.  It was the height of the pandemic and most of of my work had dried up. In February of that year, I was reminded by a fan that  Phantaz 2  was about to turn 25 years old. So, on a whim, I decided to broadcast a monthly livestream interview series to celebrate the 25th anniversary of P2, ending the project in December of 2021. So, that's what I did. I spoke to all the main players of the game (writer, director, editor, composer, actors) -- most of them for the first time since we wrapped -- and it was a BLAST! I had so much fun I didn't want to stop. So, I didn't. I live-streamed myself playing Phantaz 2 for the very first time. I started interviewing artists from the original Phantasmagoria and began a weekly play-thru of that game with the lead actress (Victoria Morsell Hemingson), began a retro-gaming happy hour on Fridays where my Patreon members decide what game I play next, and continue to interview numerous artists and creators from all sides of the retro-gaming universe. Thanks to my Patreon family, it seems that  Conversations With Curtis  is here to stay. So please join me as we jump back in time and through dimensions as we explore the world of what early point n' click & FMV gaming aspired to be and the myriad amount of current communities they cultivated.  Where will this journey will take us? I don't have a clue. But I'm excited to find out. And I'd  love  your support along the way. So, please grab yourself a Wyntech cubicle and help me grow this channel. Until then, I'll see you at the watercolor. Sincerely, Paul  (aka Curtis Craig) \n Well, that depends on the tier. But once you become a Patron of  Conversations With Curtis , not only do you automatically get early access to all of our livestreams and interviews and video newsletters, you are now officially an \"employee\" of the delightfully evil  WynTech Industries  in game designer Daniel Albu's online mini-game  FANTASMAGORIA - DIMENSION NeXt .  From applicant, to intern, to CEO, you get to climb our online \"corporate ladder\" in this incredibly fun and immersive FMV experience. (For specific details, check out the tiers ... and video below.) \n Conversations With Curtis  is a 2-person operation. Since May of 2021, Daniel Albu and I have produced a TON of content: hours and hours of livestream game-playing and over a dozen interviews with the artists that made them. All this, while working our respective full-time jobs and full-time duties as parents to young kids. We're giving as much as we can to this project and every penny we get goes to building  CwC  into the most comprehensive retro-gaming channel on the internet. "},

I'm Jaimee Harris. For ten years I worked full time (typically, two to three jobs), wrote songs, sang background vocals on other artist's records, led bands, joined bands, played anywhere that would have me, and met you. Due to the kindness and generosity of my fans, I was able to record and release my first album. In 2018, I left my day job, fell in love, hit the road full-time, and moved to Nashville.  Along the way, I've learned how to be a publishing administrator, a booking agent, a promoter, a record label, a marketer, a social media manager, a web developer, a tour manager, and a travel agent. I can get by, but I'd love to focus on what I do best: writing, singing, performing, and recording. I love what I do and I know to do it well I can not do it on my own. [insert sound of angels singing] Enter Patreon.  I've chosen Patreon as the home of my Folk 'n Roll Fan Club because it  allows me to give you access to my soul's work directly . Right here. With your support, I'll not only be able to create more  (songs, videos, recordings)  but I'll also be able to take everything I do to a much higher level (guitar lessons, vocal coaching, songwriting workshops, great album artwork, PR campaigns for releases and tours, high-quality recordings and music videos, pyrotechnics, etc...). You will be directly contributing to my growth as an artist. The best part is,  you will see and hear everything first !  Why am I doing this?   I believe that songs have the power to be more than just entertainment. I knew from the time I was five years old that I wanted to write my own songs and share them with the world. You see, I've never fit in. I've always been an outsider. I've never been a great verbal communicator. However, I have always been able to communicate with songs. Whether it's sharing a song written by another artist to say \"this is how I feel,\" or writing my own songs and sharing them with the world. Songwriting has allowed me to help make sense of my trauma, my addiction, my recovery, my strained relationships, my mental health struggles, injustice, inequality, and joy. I believe it has saved my life. By sharing these creations with you, you help me to feel less alone. It keeps me alive. It keeps me here. It keeps me sane. It keeps me connected. It's my greatest wish that it helps you, too.  That was pretty Kumbaya, but I'm into the vibe. Why Patreon? Because I would love for you to be in my pinball league. Even though I started writing songs in 2004, I had never let anyone into my process until 2017. I was vulnerable, terrified, and insecure. What I've learned since then is that sharing the creative process with y'all is kind of like being in a band. There's more magic floating around. We all lift each other. If I keep everything to myself in my cave, there are so many creations that may never fly out into the light. I have sixteen years' worth of songs, but only ten songs made it onto my debut album.  There is so much more I have to share with you!   Patreon allows me to share the creative process with you and gives me the space to share creative creations with you.  There's no suit telling me I have to wait three or four years to release content. It's just you and me. No BS. But, I'm not a bazillionaire.  Here's the deal -- I'm a folk singer. I sing songs for the folks. I was able to record, mix, master, and manufacture my debut record with 100% fan contributions. The average donation was $5! How does it work? As a Patron,  you decide how much you'd like to contribute  per month, starting at $3.  That's it. That's how it works.  All patrons will have access to everything I release in the Folk 'n Roll Fan Club. All of it.  Because of your support, I was able to play some incredible gigs, received invitations to legendary festivals, and sold out venues throughout Texas ---  all without having ever released a record.  That is NUTS. We've spent  years  building this thing together. I want every single one of you to have access to recordings and anything else I'm inspired to create. I want your input.  What kind of things can I expect to see around here? Downloads of original Jaimee Harris songs . New original songs, alternate versions of older songs, and covers. Hear them here first. For some songs, this may be the only place to hear them...ever. Behind the scenes stories and pictures.  Behind the Music...without the commercials.  Previews of completed projects . If I'm making a new record that will be released to the world, you will hear it first.  Patreon exclusive live streams.  Total request live streams? Themed live streams? You vote. I'll play.  Patreon exclusive Q&A's and panels.  I've met so many creatives and activists over the last fourteen years of doing this work. I'd love to introduce you to these wonderful humans. Since activism is a huge part of my life, I'd like to offer you Patreon exclusive Zoom interviews with incredible humans who spend every day making the world a better place.  Patreon exclusive physical goods.  If you choose to support at the $25 or higher, you will receive merch discounts, chord charts, and other physical goods (postcards, guest list spots, etc...). Anything can happen.  As we grow our Folk 'n Roll Fan Club together, I will offer specialized content and/or physical rewards when we reach certain goals.  I'm so touched that you read everything! Wow. I'm so grateful for everything you have already done to keep this ball in the playfield. I would've drained a long time ago without your support. Thank you for being such an important part of my life, my story, my career, my community, and my artistic journey. Thank you for considering taking the next step with me. I am so looking forward to seeing how we grow together. I promise to work my hardest for you, my angels. I will pour my heart and soul into every single work of art I create.

Hello, Freaks! I'm Lana, and this the patreon page for my weekly stream, The Freak Museum.  Once a week, usually late on Monday nights (or Tuesday mornings, depending on how you look at it), I play a strange and wonderful videogame you probably haven't heard of. I like stuff that's off the beaten path, surreal, oddball and unique, and I'm happy to be able to show those games to the world along with my commentary, analysis, additional info about the game and its themes, and occasional digressions into pro wrestling or lefty politics.  Here's a VOD for my stream of some of Ian MacLarty's games from my YouTube page, to get a sense of what I'm about:  ABOUT THE TIERS:  Both Patrons and Twitch Subscribers can gain access to the Discord  (for Patrons it's for as little as $1, which you can cap and cancel at any time! I think that's a pretty good deal!). There, you can watch the  FREE bonus streams  I do directly for patrons and subscribers once a week, as well as play Rocket League with us, watch a movie on the last Friday at every month that you can vote on in our Movie Poll, watch classic joshi (Japanese women's pro-wrestling) with us on Thursday nights, and get access to the unlisted  Bonus Freak Museum Streams  playlist on YouTube where the Discord VODS are archived.  -For Patrons paying $3 per piece and above, you get all that,  plus you can select up to 5 stickers of your choosing to be sent by mail. (2 stickers for $3 tiers, 3 for $5, 4 for $10, and all 5 for $15 or more).  -For Patrons paying $5 and above, you get all that,  plus you can select up to 2 High-Res 4x6 Illustrated Post-Cards of your choosing to be sent by mail.  -For Patrons paying $15 and above, you get all that,  plus you can commission a custom hand-drawn illustration from me to be sent digitally.  - For Patrons paying $25 and above, you get all that,  plus you can commission a custom hand-drawn illustration from me to be sent by mail. ABOUT ME:  As for myself, you can think of me as a sort of Elvira for very odd videogames. I've been focusing on independent and esoteric technical art for nearly a decade. I'm an art critic, artist, designer and writer. I have written for games and art magazines alike, including Rhizome, Kill Screen, Paste, Kaleidoscope, Arcade Review, Vice and Billboard. I've also written about the labour and sociopolitical side of the tech industry for RankandFile and Passage. You can also check out some of my own little games here:  https://lanathegun.itch.io/ Formerly, I wrote reviews on a website called  Sufficiently Human , and unfortunately not all of those reviews were completed due to some past health issues. To make up for that, I would like to one day put together a small booklet of reviews for all the games I never got around to writing about--but that's a long-term project.  I apologize to past patrons for not being able to meet that promise, but I am trying to make up for it both with my current work and by the eventual completion of this project. When the booklet is ready, I will be sending it out at no charge to every patron before releasing it publicly.  I have made a couple of appearances on the podcast No Cartridge hosted by Trevor Strunk ( https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/no-cartridge-audio/e/62317350  and  https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/no-cartridge-audio/e/63781295 ).  I was also a guest on Delete Your Account hosted by Roqayah Chamseddine and Kumars Salehi ( https://deleteyouraccount.libsyn.com/episode-160-gaming-the-system ). "},

For the last 14 years we have been making music and playing shows as a group. We have released 5 studio albums, 2 EPs and a  whole bunch of music videos  to match. We've toured in the UK, Europe, America and Mexico, and done all of this as an independent act. In 2013 we raised £11,000 on Kickstarter to fund our record campaign \" The Bullet Within \". That's when we realised we had an  amazing  worldwide fan-base \" The Flock \" who supported us.  We knew then that the best way to make music, is to be directly funded by the people who want you to create it. So, in 2015, we set up this Patreon page and have used it fund a whole bunch of \"things\", including our last record \" The World Conspires \", an electronica witch-core project called \" HVIRESS \", a Mishkin Fitzgerald  solo project , and we are  constantly creating  art, music and videos. So, in short, we still really need your help to carry on this project... running a band of this size and ambition is very expensive. if you love independent music as much as we do, please give what you can. You get so much for pledges that start at just $1 per \"thing\",  and  you get a \"patreon selection box\" of all the best bits when you sign up too. Result. Thank you for your un-ending support. Our next album is called  HEX , and we have already begun releasing songs and videos. We can't wait to share the next chapter of Birdeatsbaby with you!

Here's the quick and easy low-down on who we are, and why we're asking for your support. Who We Are The Daily Grail  is a website that began way back in 1998, which is devoted to intelligent discussion of topics at 'the edges' of science and history. From new technology, discoveries and ideas, to all that weirder stuff that responsible, rational people are too scared to talk about, lest they be branded a 'woo-woo' (parapsychology, UFOs, etc.). We advocate exploration of these fascinating topics with an open, but critical mind, and checking your beliefs and ego at the door. Why We Need Your Help Getting up every morning and struggling to find the time and money to justify keeping a website running for 18 years may be a hell of a way to prove your integrity, but it's not always a barrel of fun. Collecting all the links we post in our daily news, and writing articles on fascinating topics, takes some serious hours (not even counting the behind the scenes work on website administration).  Sure, there's plenty of ways to earn some money. Other websites sell their members email addresses, hide commercial links in 'sponsored posts', and find other ways. We won't do that, because...well, because we're not a-holes. So we got to thinking. We have almost 10,000 daily readers. Maybe people appreciate what we do enough to drop just $1 a month on us (or a little more, if they feel it's justified), to not only help keep the site running, but allow it to improve! A new, mobile device-friendly design. A newsletter curating the best links of the week. More fascinating articles from great writers. Perhaps even a podcast if there's enough support out there. And maybe, we could even bring further rewards (than just the website being awesome) for those that back us. For just $12 a year - surely that would sound like a good deal?  We think so, and hope you'll take the time to back us. Because everybody wins from this deal!"},

I sincerely appreciate all of your support in this next adventure. Making art for a living is truly the greatest surprise and joy.  I hope to reward your support with a unique experience. For sometime now, I've receive feedback that my style of painting is unique. More recently, as my online presence has grown and I regularly post videos of my process, I am told that my techniques of creating this aesthetic are another form of uniqueness. In this way, Helen Frankenthaler was spot on when she said, \"Technique determines aesthetic\".  I hope that through sharing more in this format, it will not only give my fans a higher level of appreciation and understanding of the work, but I also hope it pushes me to explain what I'm doing with fresh language.

Welcome!   Here on my Patreon, you will find detailed real time videos for how I create my coloured pencil portraits, my tips, tricks and techniques for coloured pencils as well as business related content. For those of you who don't know who I am, I am a 28 year old full time coloured pencil artist from the south of the UK.  Over the past five years, my work has become respected for its anatomical correctness, movement and mostly the true portrayal of character in each subject. Having a passion for horses and the British countryside from a young age, I have successfully built a varied portfolio of work using the medium of coloured pencils. This has led to various commissions from dressage champion Charlotte Dujardin CBE, Carl Hester MBE, top equestrian management company, Piaffe Ltd as well as a growing list of private clients. I have various marketing qualifications and a vast range of experience, through my own trial and error, with creating a successful art business. Thank you so much for stopping by! *** PLEASE NOTE*** Patreon takes payment on the 1st of each month so to avoid getting charged twice, I would recommend signing up at the beginning of the month rather than towards the end :)  "},

This is a place of place for learning about representational drawing and painting techniques. After many years teaching art in a academic system, I am now bringing my experience as a professional artist and instructor directly to you online. The aspirations for this page is to be a place for education and inspiration!  Why should you become a patron? The videos that are available on this page are both for art appreciators and for aspiring artists.  Each video demonstrates the stages of the painting process and the key concepts to building a successful artwork. You will be able to watch me work with oil paint on various different substrates such as linen, gessoed panel and copper panel. The tutorials are mostly focused on the portrait and how to translate the arrangement of shadow and light as well as gesture and proportion. We will employ academic techniques and visual concepts to apply to our artistic vision and expression. Occasionally other genres will be explored, such as still life, master studies and compositions with interiors.  For an overview of  how Patreon works  in general, they’ve got a great primer  HERE  to explain how it works. How often do patrons get charged?\n \n Once per month . If you \nsign up at the $10 level, independent of how many posts that are released, you will only ever \nbe charged $10 per month. The charge will incur once signing up followed by the 1st. of the month.  A bit about me: I was born in Norway and since childhood, drawing offered a world with infinite possibilities and creative joy for me. From the onset of my oil painting pursuits in my late teens, I was particularly interested in rendering the human form and emotive expressions through portraiture and mythological motifs. During my training at The Florence Academy of Art, I further developed a deep affection for the genres of still life, interiors and nature motifs. After teaching in the academic model for over 10 years, I am now dedicated to sharing my knowledge and experience as an artist online. After many years living and working abroad (Canada, Italy, Sweden and the US) I now reside in the Norwegian countryside  side with my husband, Stephen Bauman, who is also a Patreon creator, artist and instructor.

Wild creatures and wild places have always stirred me – from the first flushing pheasant that frightened me out of my socks in grandpa’s cornfield to the last whitetail that dismissed me with a wag of its tail. In my attempts to connect with this natural wonder, to become an integral part of our ecosystem and capture a bit of its mystery, I’ve photographed, hiked, hunted, birded, and fished across much of this planet. I've seen the beauty that everyone should see, survived adventures that everyone should experience. I may not have climbed the highest mountains, canoed the wildest rivers, caught the largest fish or shot the biggest bucks, but I’ve tried. Perhaps you have, too. And that’s the essential thing. Being out there, an active participant in our outdoor world. What is Patreon Patreon is way to help fund RSO content by donating as little as $5 each month. This helps me produce better, higher-quality content. Which gives you, the patron, more of the information and entertainment you enjoy. Why You Should Support Ron Spomer Outdoors Creating the solid, tested, been-there-done-that content found on Ron Spomer Outdoors requires significant investments in time and money. Cameras, microphones, guns, optics, ammo, vehicles, travel, computers… Your support can play a pivotal role in freeing me up to increase the quantity and quality of my work, much of it in answer to your direct questions. Your support will contribute significantly to the information I can produce, so I thank you for it. "},

But there isn't some enormous team making it all happen. Believe it or not, Art of the Title is  a one-person operation  supported by generous sponsors and readers like you! That's right — one person runs, manages and maintains the site and all its channels.  The costs to maintain the site are high, especially since Vimeo, our video-hosting service, decided in 2020 to suddenly raise its prices. Our fees were raised from $200 per year to $3000 per year for this service.  Though Art of the Title is a site without peer in its niche  and an important resource for many industries, it has always been primarily a labour of love. In order for the site to continue to bring you this great content, to shine a light on this amazing work, we need your help.  \nIf you find value in Art of the Title, if you’ve ever been inspired by what you've found on the site, used it as research for your projects, in your presentations, in your teaching materials, and been sucked into a time vortex of  oohs  and  ahhs , it's time to give back. Help us keep the site going. Becoming a patron of the site right here will help ensure we can continue making Art of the Title.  \nPatreon is a system that enables fans to support and engage with the creators they love. It's a crowd-funding service kind of like Kickstarter, except you can support a project on an ongoing basis, each time we publish something new. For Art of the Title, you can help the site with server and video fees and keep us producing and publishing our great content.  When you become a patron, you will receive our exclusive patron-only newsletter! As  Criterion  is to home video and  Cinefex  is to visual effects, Art of the Title is to title design. \nWe publish between one to four in-depth feature articles per month – four is the maximum. Even pledging $1 per article is a great help and will contribute toward making it possible for the site to continue in its current form – and maybe even get some minor design updates! Your support will go directly toward server and Vimeo hosting costs, toward our wonderful back-end developers, and to compensating our tiny staff for the many, many hours of work the site requires.  If you love what we're doing and want to ensure Art of the Title can continue to exist, help us by becoming a patron!

Each class is scripted and planned) Hosting (each Art webinar is hosted to introduce the artist, select the correct camera angles during the show and filter audience questions) Overhead (insurance, taxes, rent, office expenses, internet, utilities) People who can afford to contribute make it possible for us to continue finding and featuring top talent in the art sphere.

In 2012 we started a new series, Hero-U, set in a University for would-be heroes. Hero-U: Rogue to Redemption launched in 2018, and we're currently working on Summer Daze at Hero-U, with several others in the pipeline. Check out our newest games at  https://www.hero-u.com . Our games are different from most games out there. One reviewer used the words \"charm\" and \"heart\" for the type of stories we tell. Quest for Glory and Hero-U do not fit neatly into the usual game categories - They are adventure games, RPGs, dramatic stories leavened with humor and puns, mysteries, visual novels, and relationship games among a few others. Our games are not about pulse-pumping action, adrenaline, and shooting things, although some of them feature combat and stealth. They are about story and characters... and humor. Here's the thing - Although many players have written to tell us how much they love our games, we have a limited market. We appeal to gamers who love deep, detailed stories and character relationships. That's a harder sell than \"run around and shoot things!\" For now, at least, we make critically- and player-acclaimed games that don't sell enough copies to pay for their development. We raised over $500,000 on Kickstarter for Hero-U: Rogue to Redemption, but paying our developers and other expenses cost over $1 million. So far, we haven't come close to recovering that extra cost through game sales. One way for us to keep making games is to take our living expenses out of the equation. If we receive enough support here on Patreon and from other donations, we can pour all of the game income back into making more games. That's what this Patreon page is about - If you loved our games, or want to see us keep making games with heart that defy traditional categories, help us pay our expenses so we can focus on getting the games to pay for themselves. You will get some nice things too! We have some pretty cool stuff in our archives that nobody has seen in a long time. We wrote a Quest Log about games, game development, and world events. We edited the Spell Book fantasy gaming magazine with articles, stories, and poetry. We plan to regularly reprint some of those articles here, just for our Patrons. Then we'll add in new things, such as photography, art-in-progress from our upcoming games, and new posts about just about anything. We do a lot more than create games, and we'd love to share it with you."},

In my \"Piano & Keyboard Artist\" series, I do album reviews and discuss/review artists relating to keyboarded musical instruments. I not only review the artists and their music/songs/albums as a fan but I also draw from my vast experience as a Producer/Artist/Piano/Singer and I am able to also review albums in terms of musical composition, structure as well as production techniques and the vocal approaches.  My album reviews are light-hearted and fun yet at the same are thorough, in-depth and explained in an way that is easy to understand by both producers and casual music fans who are not technically minded.  My \"Geek Talk\" series focuses on the more technical aspects of Synthesizers and music production.  I also have a \"Rising Star\" series which is aimed at giving practical advice to independent artists as well as some related miscellaneous subjects and music industry advice which are appropriate for independent and up and coming artists.  I also interview famous and interesting Artists and producers including the Legendary photographer Brian Griffin (photographer of the first 5 Depeche Mode album covers and many other legendary and iconic artists) who is now a regular guest on my channel!! Your support as a Patreon will help me to embark on more ambitious projects and help me improve the quality and increase the output of my content. There are many great artists and producers that you and I would both want to speak to and interview and with your generous support, this will be possible!!  I also release my own music under my \"Vaughty\" alias and am happy to share this journey with you as well as some valuable \"behind scenes\" information which will hopefully be of value and interest to up and coming artists!!  Thank you for your time and I hope you will consider joining me on this exciting journey!!

Instead I use machines and computers as a part of my art practice—its an ends to a means, not the end.

But I’d still like to cover some of my material and art expenses, and that’s where you come in. Backing me on Patreon will be my way going forward to make a small income on my work.

I’ve been publicly writing about witchcraft and Paganism since 2010 and my message has remained constant throughout this time. I’m not the witch who’s going to hold your hand and tell you you’re pretty. I’m not going to fluff your ego and accept your excuses because I  know  you’re capable of better. If you want to deepen your practice, to be a more effective and self-reliant witch, and to strengthen your relationship with the Land, spirits, and Gods, I want to help you however I can. To that end, I provide intense divination services via throwing the bones, have produced 100+ articles, have written 13 hands-on courses, have published three books, and have more books and courses on the way. Your support provides me with a consistent income that allows me to scale back on my freelance writing clients and focus more heavily on helping people navigate the interlap between their spiritual and everyday lives, take their witchcraft deeper, and become more effective witches.  \n\n How I began Writing and Why At the end of 2010, my husband and I created a website called The Tarot Witch. It was a small attempt to combat the growing mountain of misinformation concerning witchcraft and Paganism with weekly and, later, bi-monthly articles. Around that same time, I started blogging, sharing glimpses into my personal practice, as well as sharing with you my and my husband’s experiences in raising our children Pagan and as witches and how we function as a family coven (or local family cultus if you want to get technical…) When The Tarot Witch was later shut down in 2012, the numerous articles were moved to my blog and I continued to write the bi-monthly articles as a continued effort to provide sincere and experienced based information that others could use to, hopefully, deepen their understanding of why they did things a particular way in order to strengthen their practice. I continued to write through multiple pregnancies, while juggling going to school full time and working full time, while being homeless, and even while living in the middle of the wilderness in New Mexico without power or internet.  It’s never been about the money, which is why my website has  always  been ad-free and I’ve never once pushed affiliate links or products even when I really,  really  could have used the money. I write because I am compelled to, and I write about witchcraft because after so many years of practice I cannot imagine my life without it. The support and feedback I’ve gotten from you, my treasured readers, keeps me motivated and is the entire reason I made the push to start writing books and have now managed to write 13 courses on witchcraft in just 4 years. \n\n Where the Money Goes Pledges are used to cover the costs of hosting my website and sending monthly newsletters. This supports the writing that I am currently and have been doing for 12 years. From there, pledges will be used to defer my meager living costs, allowing my family to continue to enjoy our wandery, wilderness lifestyle, and for me to devote my writing time to turning out more consistent content for  you  rather than focusing on writing for clients. There is no way for me to accurately convey how much every pledge means to me. I can only hope that the higher quantity of work that I’m able to produce thanks to your help serves to help people deepen their practices and to do more witchcraft when they may have otherwise made excuses. \n\n How Patreon Works Patreon enables creators like me to receive predictable income each month by providing a place for fans (you) to receive extra content and exclusive rewards in exchange for a small pledge. That pledge provides a predictable income that relieves some of the stress of freelance life and allows me to focus more consistently on writing on the topics that we both love. In exchange, and depending upon how much you pledge, you will receive exclusive witchcraft courses, digital copies of my self published books, access to full-size courses, and membership to my private witch community filled with toothy witches who are just as ready to discuss the deep side of witchcraft as they are to joke around and support each other through challenges in our everyday lives and spirituality. All of this is just a small way for me to show my endless appreciation for your support and encouragement. Patreon charges immediately when you first pledge and then at the 1st of the month thereafter. You are able to pledge any dollar amount you wish, however, to get the rewards associated with any tier, you must pledge at least the amount of the desired reward tier (i.e, you can pledge $15 and be at the $10 reward tier or pledge $30 and be at the $20 tier, for example). If you wish to make a one-time pledge, you can pause or cancel your pledge once the charge has gone through and Patreon will no longer take payments. Please reach out to me if you have any questions on how Patreon works or if you’re interested in others ways to support my work."},

This patreon enables the continued development of the show to be a reality.   Each episode of the show is carefully researched and prepared based on interviews, developer presentations, research papers, technical reports, textbooks and - in some instances - from interviews with developers themselves.  This is a long and time consuming process once you add in scripting, recording of the game itself and editing, with  a typical episode of the main show taking over one working week to prepare \n and this naturally has a lot of running costs.   I want to do more  and I believe in the value that  AI and Games  offers to so many people, but without the support of my audience, it's not sustainable.  In addition, while  AI and Games  receives a portion of revenue from adveriting on YouTube\n every month, it's a fraction of what my Patreon supporters provide and \nit a lot less consistent.  Hence  this Patreon is the main revenue \nstream  of the channel.  While I respect how unreliable YouTube is as a platform, I hope that you - my audience - would like to support the work.  Naturally, if you can't or don't support the show, that's absolutely fine!  I don't expect it of you all.  However, I do reward my supporters with extra goodies which I detail further down this page. ---- Why AI and games? Artificial intelligence is a big talking point these days and I use \nthis video series to talk about it in the context of games.  I run a \nseries of videos that address this topic in different ways: Case Studies How artificial intelligence is  applied   in commercial video games . How  AI research in games  is used to enhance our understanding of the field. AI 101 Explaining core AI tech in the games industry, how it works and clever ways it is used in games. Design Dive How AI applications in games  influence game design . I have an almost endless supply of new topics to cover and videos to make - and I need you to help make that a reality. ---- Why Use Patreon? Patreon - where we are right now - is a service where you can pledge support to a creator (in this case me) so they can support their work and continue to make it a reality.  Patreon is great for creators such as myself given I can remove any need for sponsorship and instead focus on creating content that my viewers are excited about.   ---- How Do Payment and Rewards Work? Patrons are charged monthly by patreon and I strive to put out one main episode a month.  As detailed in the rewards tab, patrons who sponsor at varying tiers are offered a variety of rewards, including access to the  patron-feed  here on Patreon, a  monthly newsletter , an invite to the AI and Games  Discord Server  with higher tiers offering the opportunity to  vote on new topics , get  early-access  to new videos, bonus videos such as the  Smoke and Mirrors  series, plus other behind-the-scenes content such as my  research notes  and  code from demos and examples .  ---- Any Other Disclaimers? In some instances, the authors of the work I am discussing in videos are people who I have an established professional relationship with either in the academic or game development community.  In the event this occurs, this will be disclosed in the video description."},

Each painting, for me, feels like the chance of a lifetime and every time I begin to create, I am challenged to contemplate and experiment anew. \nI have learned that intuition and impulses during the act of creating are worthy voices to be heard. And I believe it takes courage to listen and to follow. \nMy art is and eclectic mixture in both medium and content. It is ultimately unified by love, life, change and courage.   ~ kae pea"},

You might know me from my weekly interview podcast,  Off Panel . Or perhaps you know me from my subscription comic site  SKTCHD  (which I own/operate), or my previous life at the Eisner Award nominated Multiversity Comics (which I was one of the senior editors at). Or maybe you discovered me through my  gigantic piece  on The Ringer about Image Comics' history or the one about  Spider-Man's place in the zeitgeist . There are a bevy of places you could find me, but the point is, I've been writing and talking about comics for a while now - 13 years! - and it's something I'm passionate about. I love comics, and I'd love to continue to keep Off Panel as something that isn't behind the paywall of SKTCHD. That's where you come in. The life of an independent podcaster is a fun one - I report to no one but myself - which means original takes and off the cuff interviews you might not get elsewhere. That's led me to podcasts interviewing some of the most interesting people in comics, including: Brian K. Vaughan   (Saga, Paper Girls) James Tynion IV   (Something is Killing the Children, The Nice House on the Lake) Tillie Walden   (Clementine, Spinning, On a Sunbeam) Ed Brubaker   (Reckless, Criminal) Patton Oswalt & Jordan Blum   (Minor Threats, Hulu's M.O.D.O.K.) Tom King  (Love Everlasting, Human Target) Daniel Warren Johnson   (Do a Powerbomb) Faith Erin Hicks  (Ride On, The Nameless City) Kieron Gillen  (Immortal X-Men, A.X.E.: Judgment Day) Jonathan Hickman   (Three Worlds/Three Moons, X-Men) Now that SKTCHD has relaunched as a subscription site, the bulk of the content will be behind a paywall. And I don't want Off Panel to be like the rest, as I prefer to keep it open. This Patreon is now focused on doing that and offsetting the costs of the show (while making it worthwhile for me). I'm also always looking to beef up Off Panel and improve the overall quality of it, while also expanding the audience as much as I can. That can be expensive, either in actual money or simply time put in, and I'm looking to defray that however I can. Why should you support the show? Well, don't listen to me. Here are some smart people that aren't me saying nice things about Off Panel. \" Off Panel  is an oasis of great discussion on comics and the craft of making them. Every new show is the highlight of my week as I know I'll learn something new with every episode.\" - Declan Shalvey ( Injection ,  Moon Knight ) \"Like the best interviewers (and dodgeball players), David knows exactly when to get out of the way. I always learn something listening to  Off Panel .\" - John Allison ( Giant Days ,  Bad Machinery ) \"I began to take notice of David's work through his carefully researched comics journalism. And then he stopped. But all was forgiven once he started  Off Panel , a great outlet for his obvious enthusiasm about the medium and its craft.\" - Paolo Rivera ( The Valiant ,  Daredevil ) \"The best podcast about comics\" - super kind iTunes reviewer So there you have it. People like me. They really like me. And if you've enjoyed my interviews, I'd love to have your support. Anything helps.

My name is Alex Jay Brady, I'm an concept artist and illustrator. In order to be able to spend time making art outside of normal commercial work, focused mostly on Dune related stuff I've set up this Patreon. I hope I can make interesting things for you! I've read Dune every few years since I was a kid and each time its opened up a bit more. Now with the movie coming there's a huge swell of interesting analysis and discussion on the internet and thanks to the audiobooks I've been enjoying the later books far more than I used to, and so have tonnes of ideas for things to draw. My dream is one day, I can take making art for fans from a hobby to a part-time job. I want you to tell me what you'd like to see and Ill do my best to make it. Each month Ill make new sketches and you can choose which one to be taken to detailed finish. Ill make video progressions and tutorials for any techniques people might find useful in their own projects.  I hope you'll enjoy seeing the new work develop and voting for what we should look at next, and maybe sometimes there is a trick in my techniques that you can use."},

See the membership tiers and choose the one that fits you best! Be sure to carefully read the tier benefits and frequently asked questions below, to make sure you understand what comes with each membership tier before signing up. I built Createful Art to serve those that want to become better painters and artists.  In order to become better, you need art lessons. Because without the knowledge or \"why\" behind the art, your skill level can't increase. The problem is that practice alone won't get you there. Which can make you wonder if you actually have the talent when progression is slow. I'm here to tell you, that of course, you do! I believe you have unlimited potential to create whatever it is YOU want. That feeling of discouragement when you can't is no fun. I don't want anyone to feel that way! I've been there.  I remember when I couldn't even paint clouds! So I turned to books, teachers, and artists for help. A lot of what I got back was confusing, missing important info, or taught in such a long way that I lost interest when they didn't get to the point! Why not make learning art so simple that we get it, move on, and progress faster? Why not make learning art fun and encourage creativity? People like you and me, who love art, well... we want to still love art while we are learning it. Eventually, I learned the key concepts and thereby gained the knowledge I needed to become confident in my abilities. I can now enjoy painting whatever it is I want in whatever style I feel like. I want you to feel confident and have this ability too! I also want to make it as easy and pleasurable as possible for you to learn how to make art you'll love. FUN and EASY! Yay! This is how Createful Art Membership works... Step 1: Select a tier  that gives you the perks you want.  Step 2: Pace Yourself.  There's no need to paint everything as soon as I release it. Pace yourself so that you can internalize the concepts. When you become a member you get access to a lot of content and more new tutorials and/or lessons weekly. Don't get overwhelmed, take the time you need, so you can actually enjoy the learning process.   Step 3: Practice what you learn  with my tutorials. Feel free to change anything, in fact, I encourage it. Be creative! Now, watch yourself become a skilled artist, faster! Comments from Members \"I can't believe all that I am learning. Every time I study a lesson, I learn something new. Thank you Ashley.  \" ~ Shirley \"I am new to Creatful Art and so glad to be here. I loved making the llama! Also love feedback and/or ideas to help me improve.\" ~ Amy \"Been going through very tough time lately, and finally I managed to pick up the brush. Working on these colorful bright paintings truly changed my mood upside down .. so looking forward for painting the last one of this collection   thank u Ashley  \" ~ Samar About me:  My name is Ashley Krieger. I'm a momma of three, a full-time traveling artist, art teacher, and YouTuber. I have created 200+ videos that teach art lovers like you, how to create art with fun tutorials and art lessons. It is my amazing members that help me do what I love the most, thank you for your support! You can get to know me more  right here . I hope you enjoy my art lessons, I can't wait to see your progress and have fun painting! Happy Painting, ~Ashley Frequently Asked Questions: How do I find the paintings I want to paint with you?  All the lessons are organized for you on my site by category  here . When you're a member and logged in to Patreon, click on the painting you want to enjoy with me and it will take you right to the post on Patreon. The login on my site will take you to log in here on Patreon, so there is no separate log-in on my site, just the one Patreon login here that gives you access. Where should I begin?  I recommend going through the  painting course here  that takes you from a beginner to a professional artist. I would practice painting by choosing a subject you want to  learn to paint here  -  I have suggested an easy tutorial, to begin with under each subject. You could also begin, or practice, in an art journal -  https://www.createfulart.com/art_journal.html  with the lessons I send each week. Why do I not get access to previous lesson plans?  The lesson plans are incredibly valuable and worth more than the membership alone, as seen in my shop. Keep in mind that a 1hr, in-person painting lesson with me is valued at $100. I now design the same lessons into lesson plans, giving you the equivalent of $400+ worth of my knowledge and time each month for this extremely affordable price.  I also have to be fair to those who support me each month and my yearly members, who pay around $200 so they can enjoy each month's lesson plans. It wouldn't be fair to provide the same content to someone who comes for just a month and pays only $20 for access to the same amount of content.    Can I get a refund if I don't like the membership?  No. Because of the subscription nature of Patreon, which is similar to other subscription services, you get instant access to membership content and can cancel your membership at any time, but you will not receive a refund. With Createful Art membership, you get instant access to hundreds of art lessons, video tutorials, and downloadable content. To protect creators from people signing up, downloading content, and then asking for refunds, Patreon and Createful Art have a strict no-refund policy. If you're unsure about joining, I recommend enjoying my five free art lessons, and my free tutorials on YouTube to make sure you love how I teach first. Remember that all the lessons are organized on my site to make it easy for you to find content -  https://www.createfulart.com/learn.html  and make sure you are logged in on Patreon to enjoy access. Why don't I see access to all your content?  I have people in previous tiers that receive less content than you. These are locked so you will easily find the posts with more content. I also give kids lessons, and those lessons you can sign up separately for. For some older videos, you will not get access to a full tutorial, because one was not made. However, you still have access to many full tutorials, and all of this is labeled clearly when you hover over the lessons organized for you on my site -  https://www.createfulart.com/learn.html  .   If you have any additional questions before signing up, you are welcome to email them to me at  [email protected]  and if you have any questions as a member, you will be able to message me through Patreon. Please keep in mind  that Patreon began as a place to support creators so that they could continue to offer the content you are enjoying. It wasn't built as a platform for a course or to find content prior to when you become a member. However, I have set up my website to make it possible to easily find previous content and access all my previous art lessons in order to make a course at the lowest price possible. It is because of Patreon that I can serve you and so many other people around the world. It is my goal to help you become a better artist, while doing that I have to be able to support my family so that I can continue to serve you. So thank you so much for your support here and I hope you enjoy relaxing and learning to paint with me."},

I livestream 5 days\na week at twitch.tv/cahlaflour and play video games/spend time with my\ncommunity. I am a variety streamer that has a big focus in the horror genre (my\nmain game is currently Dead by Daylight).\n \n \n \nFor starters \nNo one is required to sign up for Patreon. I will continue\nto stream and create content on my social media. This is extra. Patreon is a\nplace for people to support my hobby (cosplay, behind the scene work, photography\netc). It is a monthly subscription where you pledge a dollar amount and get\nspecific rewards depending on your pledge!  \n \n What Your Pledge Means for my Channel \n Your support here means my career as a content creator is more stable. It's no secret that the gaming industry is very unpredictable and it can be very stressful on creators. Your support on Patreon means that I get to focus more on the games that I enjoy for stream and less about the numbers and paying my bills. Simply put: your support will help me focus on giving you the best content I can. \n \n What Your Pledge Means for You \n You'll get to follow along my content creation journey in a far more intimate way than you can anywhere else. I'll be posting things here that never make it to any other platform. I post random selfies/snapchats/videos, plans for the channel, cosplay work, get feedback from patrons, share announcements early and so much more! Patreon is a platform where I can be more personal with my audience. We have monthly Google Hangouts sessions where a big chunk of my community gets together and spends a night hanging out with each other. I'm very proud to say my patrons have become a super tightknit group of friends who are always around to support one another and myself. You'd get to be a part of that. Think this might be something that interests you? Take a look around and check out some of the rewards offered here. \n \n \n \n \nFAQ:\n \n \n Q :  How often do you upload content to Patreon? \n \nA : Nearly every day! Exceptions might be when I’m traveling for stream\nopportunities and conventions but during these periods I’ll be filming content\nfor Patreon. There is a Patreon snapchat that I try to post on daily with\nupdates, behind the scenes, real time cosplay work, pictures, videos you name\nit. I do multiple posts each week to the Patreon feed as well. It’s pretty busy\nin here!\n \n \n \nQ : Can I get rewards from previous months? \n \nA : Unfortunately rewards from previous months are specific to those months (if\nit is a physical reward package, digital content will always be able to be seen\nin later months you might just have to do some searching around). Sometimes I\nwill have a few things left over from previous months and I’ll throw those in\nwhen people sign up for the Twilight tier (previous months stickers, perlers,\nart etc). Those aren’t ever guaranteed but I will throw in extras when I have\nthem for people newly signing up to that tier.\n \n \n Q : When will my package be shipped out? \n A : Packages are shipped out 2 months at a time. Example: January and February's packages will ship out together a few weeks into March to allow for pledges to be processed and packaging. I do this all by myself so please be patient! \n \n Q : What if I don't want to receive a physical package in the mail? \n A : Not a problem at all, when you sign up do not include a mailing address! I will more than likely reach out just to double check with you and make sure you didn't forget it. Don't be worried if I do, I just want to make sure everyone is getting what they're paying for! \n \n \nQ : Isn’t Patreon for NSFW content? \n \nA : Nope! I am not into creating that kind of content, more power to the others\nout there that do, it just isn’t my style. You may find a cosplay to be a bit\nsexier occasionally, but it will never be NSFW or nude. I like being a goof and\nderping around. That’s more me.\n \n \n \nQ : When will I be charged for my pledge? \n \nA : As soon as you sign up or upgrade your tier. After that you will be billed\nthe first of the month. You will have until the last day of each month to make\nsure you signed up to receive the physical mailed out rewards for that month\n(plus its digital content). Example: You sign up as a $50 patron in January and\nupgrade your tier to $100 January 31st. You will be charged the extra $50 on\nthe upgrade day and you will be a Twilight dragon for January. Then you will be\ncharged $100 February 1st for February’s package. If you’re ever unsure, check\nyour email to see exactly what the pledge was for.\n \n \n \nQ : I’m having an issue with Patreon billing? \n \nA : If you ever have any questions or issues with Patreon billing, please refer\nto this page: \n https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/categories/360000481411-PATRON-BILLING \n \n \nQ : This didn’t answer my question? \n \nA : If your issue isn't listed or your question answered from\nreading those topics, please send them a ticket with your issue: \n https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/requests/new \n \nPlease note that the creators have nothing to do\nwith billing, they are busy creating content for you! I'm sorry for any\nconfusion. The upfront billing is new this year and I'm trying to make sure\neveryone is on the same page. Thanks!\n"},

Et à terme, j'ai plein d'autres envies : des podcasts en avant-première voire en exclusivité, des interactions pour creuser les discussions qu'on peut avoir sur Twitch, des vidéos, peut-être des contenus érotiques, et bien sûr des inventions à co-créer avec vous ! Se lancer en indé sur Internet, c'est prendre le pari de gagner sa vie sans filet de sécurité,  a fortiori  lorsqu'on est une femme et qu'on ouvre grand sa bouche sur plein de sujets délicieux de type : l'égalité, la culture nerd, la sexualité.

Of course, the story will be fully  SFW , thus it's suitable for everyone to read, and the story will be divided in a number of chapters, which I can't specify yet at this time. \n \nOf course there are other comics, doujins, or any other works I'm planning on, but I'll start slowly and grow in time. \n \n Current Projects: \n- My Girlfriend's a Hex Maniac \n- Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Phantom Hearts (Cancelled) \n- TBA \n \n Rewards: \n-  Drafts/Sketches \n-  Outlines \n-  Monthly Theme Art (ComingSoon) \n \nIf any of you are curious of my other works you can check out my  Deviantart, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr blog (which I don't use that often anymore ): \n \n Deviantart:  https://mgx0.deviantart.com/ \n Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/mgxzr0 \n Twitter:  https://twitter.com/therealmgx0 \n Tumblr:  https://mgx0.tumblr.com/ \n Newgrounds:  https://mgx0.newgrounds.com/ \n Tapas:  https://tapas.io/mgxzer0 \n \n Rewards: \n You will receive all kinds of cool stuff! Behind the scenes, drafts, character art and more! Although for those who pledge higher, it might take a while for me to get them done since I always get these things too clean and perfect which can go overboard sometimes ^^; \n \nBut I promise, I will get these rewards done with top quality art. And you won't be disappointed! \n \n Other Details: \nYou may be wondering whether your pledge will be worth the investment. For starters, you're contribution will be help me greatly in terms of living expenses like bills, food, and rent.

I spend some years travelling around the world as a digital nomad and after many adventures, I settled down in Spain to focus on  developing my artistic and literature projects . If you came here to take a peek at what I’m doing or support my weirdness, THANK YOU. I've been creating content for years, in front of and behind the cameras, through my social networks,  YouTube  and the media I write for. My goal is to be able to  keep making projects that are interesting for me and my audience , without giving in to the demands of the market or the requirements of the media. Why Patreon?  The cost of creating is high, and for many years I’ve spent more time and resources looking for distributors and sponsors instead of doing what I really have to do: CREATE. Patreon allows my content to be  independent, diverse and also risky. Self-managed and self-funded . Free from the limits imposed by brands and distributors. This platform is designed so that people who want to help me to continue creating can do so by contributing monthly the amount of money they decide . This way I can focus entirely on creating Stuff™ that I believe without having to think about “what will sell more.” Artworks, photo shoots, videos, texts and much more! My challenge for 2020 is to publish my second book, an essay about feminism in which I analyze the experience of going through the world as a woman. Besides allowing me to skip the commercial system, Patreon helps me  to connect directly with my followers . Create a direct relationship with each of you and that we can, together, build a community where we share our thoughts and ideas. If all this seems interesting and you want to  join me in this creative process , you are in the right place! ♥  ♥   What’s this, how does it work?  -  Patreon is a micro patronage website. This means that you can contribute the amount of money YOU decide each month, and in return you will receive different rewards like stickers, original artwork, exclusive content and my unconditional love. By clicking on \"Become a Patron” and filling the required information, you'll get access to exclusive posts instantly. And don't worry, you can withdraw your contribution at any time :) For more info, visit the  Patreon FAQ . What happens when I pledge? -  You will see a confirmation page. If your pledge amount comes with digital rewards you'll be able to see a post in the creator’s section where I explain how to access the patron-only area. Physical rewards are sent at the beginning of the next month. What will you use the money for? - I firmly believe that if we all share the knowledge we have, the world would be a much better place. That’s why I want to focus on projects that involve as much public content as possible. But to get to this point I need support, help and patronage. I need to pay for my video and photography equipment, and the people who work with me. The costs to develop and maintain my website, the gas, the tickets. That’s why I come to you.  I still don't understand, please help me!  -  Don't panic! I understand that this system may seem complicated at first. If after reading this FAQ you still have any doubts about how it works or how to pledge, please send an email to  [email protected]   and I will help answer your questions. Where can I find out more about you and your projects?  -  You can find me on  Twitter ,  Instagram ,  Facebook  and of course my  YouTube  channel and my personal  website . If you've made it this far, I want to let you know that YOU'RE AWESOME…  And I'm forever grateful for this opportunity  ♥"},

I am among some very admired, respected and hugely dedicated journalists that include Eva Bartlett, Sharmine Narwani, Whitney Webb and Finian Cunningham.  The award is in memory of Serena Shim who exposed the criminal incubation of terrorism inside Turkey and its export into Syrian territory via the Turkish borders. Serena was very probably murdered by Turkish intelligence for daring to expose their role in the destabilisation of their neighbour, Syria. Thank you Serena for being a lone light in the darkness during 2014, you are an inspiration to so many. I will do my best to live up to the example you set for us.  2018 - British National Council for the Training of Journalists (NCTJ) named Vanessa Beeley as one of the Top 238 most respected journalists in the UK. http://www.nctj.com/latestnews/nctj-publishes-list-of-most-respected-journalists My work needs me to be able to travel to the areas where my government and your government are doing the most damage, where the people of those countries are not given a fair hearing by the state-aligned media that is working within a frame that best serves their government, the military industrial complex and the corporatocracy. The majority of \"official\" media outlets in the West are agents for power. I aspire to be a humble agent for the people in any way I can and my most effective contribution is my voice and my words that can transmit the voices of the \"disappeared\" and the \"unheard\".  We are all struggling and I have a total aversion towards asking for anything for myself but I simply cannot continue to do what I do without your financial help. I promise that I will continue to dedicate pretty much every waking hour to my research, travel, speaking and writing in protest against the perpetual cycle of war and chaos that is being generated by the ruling establishment and their aligned institutions, including the colonial media.  We cannot fight alone, we are all connected by the human threads that bind us. Thank you. “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.”  - Martin Luther King Read more about me and find more of my work at  www.thewallwillfall.org One of my most important investigations has been into the NATO-member-state financed pseudo \"humanitarian\" non-NGO operating in Islamofascist controlled areas of Syria - the White Helmets. Below you will find a selection of my work on this shadow state, propaganda construct that has worked to criminalise the Syrian government and Syrian Arab Army on behalf of their bankrollers in the West and Gulf states. The much acclaimed journalist and filmmaker,  John Pilger  has endorsed my work on the White Helmets:  \"Vanessa is a fine reporter, who was one of the finalists in the 2017 Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism, perhaps the most distinguished award for truly independent journalism in Britain, which the Guardian itself was proud to receive in the past. What the bullies and censors can't stand is that she has exposed the fraudulence of the UK and US funded 'White Helmets' and so they resort to craven smears.\" International criminal lawyer,  Christopher C Black  made this statement about the White Helmets:  “Nicolo Machiavelli wrote in The Prince that deception is the principal means by which people can be controlled.  Sun Tzu in The Art of War stated that the art of deception is the first art of war, above all others, and it is deception that the citizens of the NATO countries are faced with in the aggression being conducted against the government and people of Syria. Using special propaganda units such as The White Helmets, which several NATO countries now freely admit they finance and support, the aggressor nations try to justify their war against Syria. Part of the deception is that this unit is a non-governmental organisation but the admissions about NATO support destroy that argument. They are clearly a very governmental organisation. But more than that the work of Vanessa Beeley, Eva Bartlett, Mark Taliano and others about their origins, military and intelligence connections and operations establishes that they are in reality a military propaganda unit, acting within the units of the proxy forces they support, carrying weapons, engaging in hostilities on the side of the NATO proxy forces, acting as a cover for their crimes, generating anti-Syrian disinformation and, when the proxy forces flee government forces, fleeing with them. They are not a “humanitarian aid group” to be praised but a military propaganda unit, combatants in disguise, to be condemned. And since they are part of the NATO war machine attacking Syria they are war criminals.”  SELECTION OF ARTICLES and INTERVIEWS - I will be adding to them daily.  THE REAL SYRIA CIVIL DEFENCE The REAL Syria Civil Defence  Exposes Fake 'White Helmets' as Terrorist-linked Imposters.  The REAL Syria Civil Defence  Saving Real Syrians NOT Oscar Winning White Helmets Saving Al Qaeda.

My original hope with HawkBlogger was to create a respectful and passionate community that could come together to discuss what they love in a safe place. I believe Patreon will help us form that community because you have to pay to enter. Just being a random fan with a smart phone is not enough.  I would like to be writing for you, and providing the coverage you care about, and spend less time caring about the masses. It can make being a Seahawks fan even better. I know, because I have met many of you over the years.  So, join us. Let's build a community of great people to talk about the team we all love. About Brian (and HawkBlogger.com) 1984 - Became a Seahawks fan because my favorite colors were green and blue and we lived in Oregon 1993 - Went to college intending to be a sports journalist 1995 - Realized journalists were making $14K/year and the job market was shrinking, with little control over their schedules, so I started exploring other careers 1997 - Moved to Seattle after graduating and bought my first pair of Seahawks season tickets for $200. They were on the 50-yard line in the very last row of the Kingdome 2000 - Started writing a season preview for friends via email 2007 - Started my blog  hawkblogger.com  on the advice of a friend 2012 - Started accepting ad dollars and donating over 100% of proceeds to charity (Ben's Fund) 2013 - Watched front and center as my dream came true when the Seahawks whooped the Broncos in the Super Bowl 2015 - Crossed the $50K mark in donations to Ben's Fund 2017 - Started a Patreon page to create a closer connection with the most passionate Seahawks fans and turbo-boost annual contributions to charity Sports are an escape. There are precious few safe places to care passionately about something while actively disagreeing. Politics, religion, and even the food we choose to eat highlight what divides people and pushes them into smaller and smaller corners. People across all those divides come together to cheer, celebrate, and even hug one another in the name of sport. No sports community is stronger than the 12s who stand behind the Seahawks. My goal when I started  Hawkblogger.com  in 2007 was to create a place where Seahawks fans could gather and share in their obsession. I had graduated American University ten years prior with a degree in print journalism, with an eye on becoming a sports writer, but instead found success in technology working for Adobe Systems, Inc. The Seahawks were always my favorite team, and the blog provided the outlet I craved. Things started slowly, with just a handful of readers. That was plenty for me. It was a small community, but a community nonetheless. It grew into much more. Tens became hundreds and then thousands and now the top independent Seahawks blog on the web, visited by millions of people. It has been a thrilling and humbling experience. Unlike typical sports coverage, Hawkblogger.com prioritizes analysis over superficial breaking news. Long form articles are the norm. People come here to learn not only about their favorite team, but about the game they love. They hear from someone who has seen every Seahawks game since the mid-80s, and who obsessively catalogs every detail about team performance. Articles range from deep analytics to pure emotional experience. Reading  The Morning After  column has become a Seattle sports fan ritual. My job at Adobe means I do not need the revenue generated from this blog, so I made the decision in 2012 to donate all proceeds to charity. I have a two sons, and the youngest has special needs. John Schneider, GM of the Seahawks, has a son with autism. His wife, Traci, started a charity called Ben's Fund that benefits parents who cannot afford expensive autism treatments. It seemed like the perfect way to complete the virtuous cycle I had in mind when starting this blog. Every person who joins the Hawkblogger community, or just reads a story, gives back through this system."},

That alone means so much to me and I appreciate!  Ok now for real. Hey there! My name is Karen and I am an Art Doll creator. Way back in high school (2012...totally not that long ago)  I started playing with clay and man was I in love with the stuff! There was just one problem, I hated how once it was baked and painted that was it, you couldn't change anything about it. I couldn't stand that as I always wanted to re-position them in a  pose I thought would be more fitting. It bugged me so much that I had to see if there was any way around it. I was certainly not disappointed when I discovered art dolls, it was exactly what I as looking for. A realistic looking and feeling sculpture that moves! Never stuck in a single pose and is interactive. The addiction began then and 4 years later I'm even more in love. In the past 4 years I've had enormous joy making and sharing these creations with you, Connecting with you guys, and just recently opening the doors to this beautiful art form for you all to learn and try for yourself! While I don't plan on giving this up anytime soon I will admit it is really hard to manage my passion and function in the real world and this is where I'm hoping you can help me! I am burning with passion and dreams to make this a full-time reality. While that does get the ball rolling, finances and lack of time can really hinder things. I currently work 40+ hours a week working a \"real 8-5 job\" On a typical day I have around 4-5 hours of free time and in that time I have to cook, clean, do any errands I may need and then try to get in the zone and let my imagination flow.  After awhile that can run anyone down! My dream is to be able to make art full-time as my career and teach and inspire people to let their imaginations flow! This is will take many years for me to accomplish alone but with your help I think we can get there! With your donations I will be able to expand the horizons on my art, my set ups for how I teach you and lets be honest pay the bills! I will be able to be full time and share all my ideas freely with the world! I of course have perks for you guys as a huge thank you for taking a leap of faith in me. I have so many cool things planned for Patreon like: Exclusive PDF tutorials and videos only you guys will get! Get access to sales, adoptions and videos before anyone else Behind the scenes and work in progress shots  Exclusive giveaways  Discounts if you'd like to adopt one of my creations  Full length videos of art dolls to really get a detailed look on how things are done!  I also have cool things planned if things go well like: Livestreaming Diy Doll kits for you guys to practice Mini art dolls  Community based art doll creations!  And much more If you've made it through all this I thank you greatly for taking the time to read about a girls dream to shine a little creativity onto the world. I can't wait to show you what I've got! >:)"},

I appreciate all of the support! :)"},

We're Mitch and Kyle Lucas, two brothers who have set it as our goal to create our first comic/manga \"PROJECT DIVIDER.\" Our Journey  In 2015 the two of us found ourselves working together at the same job after not speaking to each other for years. We hated that job but it was during that time we spent every free moment creating ideas for a world together. After giving up on art for years, my passion was restored in the excitement of drawing ideas for a fantasy world the two of us created. My older brother Kyle went to school for literature, creative and script writing. As we both felt lost, without a purpose and direction in life, we set our ambition on improving our creative skills and chasing a dream to create our first comic. Five years have passed since that day and we are so fortunate to have met such an amazing supportive community online. Our drive and motivation for this project has only become stronger, with your help, we hope to truly make this dream come true.     \"How does it work?\"   Our goal is to make Project Divider our main focus, by creating a Patreon we hope to raise enough for Project Divider to be a monthly comic/manga release! If you'd like to support us, we currently have two rewards available (more are in development):  We'd like to offer our $3 backers the ability to read our comic chapters and pages in a digital, high resolution comic/manga format.  The higher the tier, the more rewards we offer!!  At the moment, we have to work freelance jobs for our income, until we meet our goal please expect 2 - 8  manga pages per month =). Your rewards will be delivered either on the Patreon page or email on the 7-8th of each month, you'll be charged on the 1st.    We both want to say thank you so much for considering funding Project Divider. This dream and project could not be possible without all of you. You are the community that pushes us for forward. Thank you, for encouraging and motivating us. Let's make this happen together! With your support we can make this dream a reality! Mitch and Kyle The Divider Bros"},

I am incredibly inspired for the \n new music , developing sound, covers, tours and so much more! And I want you guys to come along for the ride!  \n \nBut \n first , some of you are new here and some of you are old and I just want to talk a little about  the journey  that has led up to now: \n \nFor the last few years, I have had the opportunity of relentlessly and passionately pouring my entire being into creating music and touring the world.  I’ve released a ton of original music, covers and some very fun videos that have reached millions of viewers around the world. \n \nFor many young musicians, this is the dream and I am so fortunate and grateful to be at this place in my career. \n \n \n \n DMF is so much more than a band. We are a community. We are a family.  \n \n \nI’ve seen first hand the affect that the music and videos can have to \n heal & inspire  within our DMF family. From sparking a smile, brightening someone’s day, helping them through depression or suicidal thoughts, or even inspiring people chase their own crazy dreams, the impact within our community is incredibly powerful. So many of our fans have found best friends through the music. Countless people have told me how the music has given them hope to persevere through tough times.  \n \n That is exactly what DMF stands for... Perseverance. \n I have had so many stumbling blocks and immense setbacks in my own journey that have led me to almost give up my music and everything I’ve fought so hard to achieve.  Sometimes the healer is the one that actually needs the healing.  \n \n \n But if you know me, you know that  I will never give up.  \n \nAnd I know that you believe in me and the music. Your support keeps me going.  \n So here’s the deal... \n \nWelcome to the Future. The only time we should ever be looking back is to see how far we come.\n \nUnderstanding the impact we can make is so important. DMF is evolving. This is about\n  passionately  creating great content, building a strong community and inspire others to be the best that they can be. Change is in the air and have learned a lot about what works and what doesn’t work. I will be creating art with more passion than you have ever seen before. And I want to grow and change with you. \n \nAnd that is where Patreon comes in and helps strengthen this process. \n \n \n What is Patreon? \n Honestly... Just watch this!  Patreon is an incredible platform that enhances our relationship! You can directly support the music and creation and get some \n sweet rewards  as a thank you for your support! In essence you become a patron of the art (hopefully you like our art :). In this case you would be pledging to donate a small amount for every creation that is released! \n \nYOU are the solution! Without you, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find the resources to create and release the content I want to create.  Soooooo...I need your support, your patronage, YOU, so that I can continue share more art with you. When I’m inspired, I like to create, and  you guys make it possible! You guys keep me doing what I love to do! I am SO fortunate to have you!\n \n \n**You can contribute as much as you want or nothing at all! I am so grateful to have you listen to the music and watch our videos. The pledges that you give will ONLY take place when we release actual music videos for originals and covers. \n Vlogs, tour BTS, and other random videos we upload won't apply . Realistically we will be uploading 1-2 music videos a month. (You can be a patron for however long you want and cancel at any time as well.) \nThank you all so much for the love!\n \n \nDavid"},

I like genre fiction and adventures, and strive to avoid some of the cliches that are overused in a lot of queer media. I want to actively court readers who aren't normally represented in comics. Many of my comics are completed stories, while others are ongoing, so there's lot of archives to binge and new content to look forward to. My latest comic,  Spectacle , is being published by Oni Press, but publishing schedules mean I do a lot of work for a year or two before anyone sees (and pays) for what I make, so this patreon helps fill in those gaps and keeps things stable for me. NSFW Patreon  |  Main Site  |  Store Spectacle  |  Love is Strange  |  YU+ME  |  Meaty Yogurt Twitter  |  Facebook  |  Instagram As it turns out, I don't really love putting things behind a paywall , and it kept me from being very motivated to post things here in the past. I also typically aim my work at the queer community which is full of people who don't have a lot of money, and I want to stay accessible. I'd rather have 500 people pledging $1 each than ten people pledging $50. So I'll be keeping digital rewards cheap. $1+ to pledge  and support my career so I can keep making the comics you love. I'll post bonus sketches, doodles, stuff like that, and you'll get to see it first. After a few months it'll go public. $8/$10+ to get a postcard  sent to you in the mail every month. $8 for people in the USA, $10 for international because those stamps are more expensive. Those are the only rewards for the time being. Sweet and simple. I may do more in the future, like coloring book pages and opportunities for traditional art commissions.

This Patreon has a simple goal: to allow me to dedicate more time to drawing, so that I can durably maintain the amount and quality of the contents I create, and ideally increase both. By supporting me, not only will you help achieve this (and for that get my eternal thanks!) but you'll also get access to what I create before it's publicly released and get a voice in what I'll create next. If that sounds interesting to you, then I'll let you take a look at the different tiers and benefits that come with them. Whether or not you choose to help me through this Patreon, it's a pleasure to have you all around, the many years I've been drawing have proven it more than once. Big thanks to all those who decide to support me!"},

I'm a wedding photographer based out of Washington DC (Baltimore, Maryland area, really!) and my photography work can be found here: --  http://www.nessakphotography.com I also do illustrations and those can be found here:  https://www.instagram.com/nessakdraws/ Things about me:  I live in a triangle shaped house, I have a dachshund named Popcorn, and a cat named Pickles. I listen to Harry Potter audiobooks to fall asleep, I love a good ink pen, I dress like it's the 1970s, and I thought I was going to marry either Dean Martin or Elvis when I was growing up.  Background:  I have a BFA in Photography, I shoot (at least) 25 weddings a year and have been a full time wedding photographer for the past 9 years (that's at least 225 and that's all the math I want to do), and I love science,  research,  workflows, optimization, and productivity. A lot. If you're here, expect a lot of links to references in the show notes.  I've given talks on lighting, photography, and business mindfulness at conferences around the world (From Sweden to the UK to our friendly neighbors of the north in Canada, and all around the United States) and given workshops to lovely groups of photographers around the world, too. In all of this experience, I've learned a really cool thing about myself;  I love education MUCH more than I love being comfortable  because public speaking is my own personal nightmare.  So here we are. A place where I can share over a decade of my business and photography experiences, without you having to sit in an auditorium seat (you probably would've gotten the seat with gum in it and thought you're unlucky, but they all have gum in them. Every auditorium seat is covered in gum). And me, getting to sharing what I've learned over the years, without standing in front of a podium, in an auditorium, in front of 500 people. I hope you're as excited about this idea as I am. <3  Things I love:  Terrible art films, all varieties of tea, Wes Anderson, songs with clapping, The Office, watching people make food, Amelie, drawing as much as possible, experiential splurges (like paying to meet and pet a penguin or flying to France to hear my voice echo around the monastery at Mont Saint Michel), and typing on a loud, clacking typewriter keyboard. "},

We manage Books and Bao, a literature, travel, and culture site. Books and Bao explores and celebrates the best of literature in translation from around the world, as well as queer fiction and books by people of colour. We publish regular articles and YouTube videos that share our love of world literature. As digital nomads, we also take deep cultural dives into every place we visit, sharing articles and videos about food, architecture, history, art, and more. What will you be funding? As both a website and a YouTube channel, we put out weekly content in both written and video form, with the dual goal of educating and entertaining. Our written articles take the form of reviews, listicles, analyses, interviews, and recommendations. Our videos include frequent book reviews, Q&As, lists, personal vlogs, and artist spotlights. Our site publishes at least one new article each week, while also consistently updating old content to keep it relevant. Our YouTube channel publishes at least two videos each week, keeping up-to-date with the best of current literature. Managing both of these takes an increasing amount of work, and you will help to fund the production of every part of that. Your support allows us to continue putting more and more time and effort into both our written and our video content. Why support Books and Bao on Patreon? We do what we do because we believe, in earnest, in the wonders of world literature, in the digital nomad lifestyle, and in seeing the most meaningful parts of every country and culture. We want to make a lasting impression on the worlds of literature and travel. We also want to be the best writers, filmmakers, and editors we can be. Your support will go a long way to support that. With your support, we can put even more time and effort into providing travel and literature content for you to read and watch. If you need more of a reason to support us, you can check out our tiers and the rewards that they come with. Every tier provides you with something awesome that you'll get as a thank you for supporting Books and Bao!"},

You're helping me support myself and if it goes well I can keep this as a tip jar rather than a paywall. Most, if not all content will be available after a certain amount of exclusivity.  \nI offer some benefits for patrons.  Every month I hold a poll where patrons from the $5 tier and up can offer suggestions for a pinup. Soon after everyone at the $3 tier and up can vote on which of those suggestions they like best. If everything goes well I get a pinup out that month.  \n\nAt the $7 and up tiers you can  access  the PDFs of all the comics I post the moment I post them. I do not sell them. So long as you're a patron you can  access  them and can read ALL the comics in pdf form.  Please try your best not to repost my stuff without a source link, a link to this patreon, and/or my twitter. As it does a lot of good will by me when you do!  I know stuff gets shared, do good by me and I'll try my best to do good by you!   Access to comics follows this schedule:\n \nMini Comics: Comics Patrons get these first, including PDF access. The following week, all Patrons get access to the image post of said mini Comic. The week after that I release the mini comic for free on Twitter and other galleries. Unless it's a mini comic of monthly. then those are released to all the day i finish them. \n\nFull Patreon Exclusive Comics: Full comics are released on PDF to Comics Patrons and higher tiers. A month afterwards all Patrons will have access to the image version of of the comic. Non-Patrons will see the comic posted slowly throughout the month on twitter and other gallery sites.  I don't guarantee a full new exclusive comic every month, that'd stress me out to no end.  But I'll try my best to provide new content every month.   HOW TO FIND STUFF ON PATREON.

I'd like to create artwork more regularly, but the unfortunate truth is that working a day job and finding time to draw is getting harder and harder. My ultimate goal is to start drawing my comics full-time, but to do that I'm going to need support. The Underburbs  has always been a two-man operation, and both my partner T.J. Dort and I work full-time jobs as we try to crank out a comic book or two every year. Every dollar we make from book sales goes right back into buying materials, printing more books, and paying for table space at comic cons. Your contributions will help not only with that, but also meeting the requirements to get national distribution. In the meantime, I'll do my best to keep this place full of artwork at all times. You can expect sketches of original and fan art, pages of the comics in progress, and any other fun little doodles to keep me busy and hopefully keep you entertained. In addition to all the behind-the-scenes  Underburbs  stuff, I'll also be making the sequences and mini-comics that my DeviantArt followers have come to know."},

If you've watched my painting videos before, thank you! If you haven't yet, well, there's a bunch of content waiting for you right now, so head to my YouTube channel first, will ya? ;) I'm a professional artist with 15 years' experience in the film, TV, game, and print industries - primarily as a concept artist and illustrator. I also happen to believe that it's the duty of experienced artists to pass on what they've learned, with no BS and for as low-cost as possible. It's for that reason that I'm a passionate teacher. I currently teach at CGMA, and have previously taught at Academy of Art University, Centennial College, and more.  I've also been making YouTube content since 2008. My videos range from painting fundamentals, to applied painting demos, to insights into how to grow (and work) as a creative person. Many of you have reached out and encouraged me to keep producing videos, and that's exactly what I plan to do! This patreon is just a small way for you to help me out as I balance a busy freelance schedule with the time required to make quality painting videos.  Thank you very much! Why a per-creation basis and not monthly? How often can I expect a new release? I typically spend anywhere between  15 - 40 hours per video  (the more edited and refined a video is, the longer it takes to produce). As of 2017, my plan is to release new content every 4-6 weeks. For this reason, it makes the most sense to ask for your support per video, rather than monthly. (Patreon provides the option to set a cap per month to ensure you're never overextending your budget!) What do I get in return?  As you'll see, there's lots of juicy stuff in exchange for your support; it's all outlined in the rewards section. These include early access to new videos, exclusive Q&As and streaming, free Gumroad videos, access to works-in-progress and unpublished close-ups, Photoshop brushes, free art prints, and extra tutorials not available on my YouTube channel. Got any other questions?  No problem - just email me at  [email protected]"},

I am passionate about making yarn! There is something about spinning that is deeply satisfying to my soul. Do you find that is true for you as well? Since before the beginning of recorded history, humans have been spinning material to create fabric for clothing, and other useful items.  Spinning connects us to  our ancestors, our history,  our planet,  our woolly friends,  our own creativity,  and to each other through the fiber community. I invite you to join a spinning journey with me. I am creating free content on YouTube to help new spinners learn how their spinning wheel works and how to spin yarn. I also share projects about using handspun yarn and looking at the different spinning techniques and equipment used in various cultures throughout history. Your patronage allows me to do these things and more! I am offering amazing bonus content, and patron exclusives as a way to thank you for your support. Some of these bonuses include: Exclusive polls to determine upcoming YouTube video topics Private Discord Channels Live Fleece to Sweater Workshops Monthly Zoom Chats Private Spinning Lessons More fiber fun!

Room Escape Artist   began in 2014 with our musings about escape rooms. Seven years and more than 2,000 blog posts later, it's grown into so much more than a daily publication. Daily Publication Reviews   - We review real-life escape rooms as well as online and tabletop escape games. Our reviews commend ingenuity and provide constructive feedback. In 2021, we expanded our writers and added hivemind reviews where we share multiple perspectives within a single review. Commentary  - These thought pieces unpack and analyze issues in the escape room community Interviews  - We share the stories of the extraordinary players and creators we meet through interviews. Beyond Writing REPOD  - On The  Reality Escape Pod , hosts David Spira & Peih-Gee Law explore immersive gaming from all angles, alongside guests with incredible experience in this realm. After a successful first season in early 2021, we welcomed Neil Patrick Harris on Season 2 Episode 1. Resources Directory  - We maintain a  directory  of escape room facilities in the United States. Industry Reports  - We release annual data-driven  industry reports , based on trends from our directory and more detailed reports based on survey data of industry professionals and players. Awards  - Each year, our Golden Lock Award highlights some finest escape rooms in the world. Events RECON  - The  Reality Escape Convention  is our annual convention that brings escape room professionals and players together for 2 days of connection, learning, and sharing. RECON will be back digitally (accessible globally!) in August 2021 after a successful 2020 event. Escape Immerse Explore  - Since 2017, we’ve hosted  escape room tours  to escape room destination cities where you can play some of the most impressive escape rooms in the world with teammates who will truly appreciate these experiences. Meetups  -  In our local New York City and whenever we travel, we bring the community together to share ideas, trade stories, and find teammates. Media Speaking Engagements  - We speak at conferences and other industry events about different facets of the escape room industry. Journalists  - We help journalists get the insights and connections they need to cover this industry. These publications include The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, USA Today, and  CBS Sunday Morning . All of the content at RoomEscapeArtist.com is available for FREE. The Patreon doesn't change that. However, the support we’ve received since we launched this Patreon in 2018 has led directly to the creation of RECON and REPOD, and to many specific pieces we’ve researched and written over the years, among other projects. We wouldn’t be where we are today with our community of Patreon backers and the incredible team of people who write for REA, produce the podcast, manage the directory, create the insane undertaking that is RECON, and advise us at every turn. Please join our Patreon community and support us in providing resources to enable a sustainable escape room industry for many years to come. \n \n \n Future Growth \n Upgrade the website infrastructure  so that you can more easily find the content you seek. Launch a new directory  with a mobile-friendly UI for you, less work on the backend for us, and new features for everyone. Write more commentary pieces ... the type that takes many hours of research, interviews, and data analysis. Highlight games in the other parts of the United States . Our travels thus far have been primarily coastal, and occasionally international. We know that there are many more incredible games in other parts of this country just waiting to be discovered, written about, and shared.  Develop new types of events  – like the Escape Immerse Explore tours & RECON – that bring like-minded folks together. Launch  a whole bunch of super-secret projects that we aren’t sharing yet!  \n \nYou will support our mission to provide well-researched, rational, and reasonably humorous pieces that push the industry forward. You will support our efforts to build a community of players and creators that will sustain the escape room industry for the future.\n We both work day jobs. All of the content you read is created on weekends and in the evenings… and late into the night. We are at capacity. We have more ideas than we can possibly create in off hours. With your support, we will give more time to Room Escape Artist. \n \n Curious where the names for the support levels come from? \n Our Not-So-Secret Origin Story \n \nWe met in a bar on a snowy evening, only a few days after David had visited Escape the Room NYC, the first escape room to open on the east coast of the US.  \"David was describing this room filled with interactive puzzles and the excitement of solving them in the nick of time. I was intrigued.\" \"I asked for her number... and now we're married and writing this blog together.\"  \nAs we played escape rooms together in 2014, we encouraged our friends to join in. David wrote a blog post called \n Real Life Escape the Room 101  (on his personal blog) to give folks a sense of what to expect going in. That calmed fears of the unknown and created more functional team dynamics. \n \nThen we brought some friends to a really terrible room. That happened in the early days because the Internet couldn’t tell us which games would be good. David decided to give the Internet some knowledge. He wrote a review warning people away from this escape room… and promising that it didn’t represent all escape rooms.\n \n \nIn August of 2014, we spent an afternoon with the Internet, searching for all escape rooms in the US. The first step to playing them was finding them. Lisa made a Google map and its companion Google sheet.\n \n \nWe launched Room Escape Artist with these few blog posts and a directory of  2 dozen escape rooms . We wanted to share our love of letting strangers lock us inside giant puzzles, and to push the makers of those giant puzzles to create the best experiences they can. \n \nSince that snowy evening in a bar,  David proposed  (with a puzzle box!), we got married (with a  wedding puzzle! ), and we started a life together. David thinks up new ideas. Lisa keeps the ideas going. Together, we built a thing much bigger than each of us. \n \n Words from the Community \n \n \n“You put the fuzzy ideas I had about escape rooms into words much better than I could!” – Joanna  \n \n“I read Room Escape Artist every day. I have no idea how you two do it, and I am personally in debt to you as an escape room owner. You're bringing up the escape room industry into a mature art form.” – Haley E. R. Cooper, Strange Bird Immersive, Houston, TX, USA\n \n \n“Your blog has been an invaluable resource as I have designed and am now building my first Escape Room(s). You critiques encourage and frighten me. My decisions are influenced by this question: \n What would David & Lisa think?  The answer compels me to reach a litter higher... Thanks.” – Jim, Paradox Squared, Woodstock, IL, USA “Room Escape Artist is a gem in the vast desert of the escape room/puzzle scene. With their daily coverage and detailed reviews, David and Lisa Spira are doing something extraordinary.” – Ben Rosner, New York, NY, USA \n \n“Your description about 'The Question of Best' is why REA is so valuable to the rest of us. 'Best' is a flawed term for escape rooms, but without question, is not going away. There is no 'Best' ice cream flavor though there are definitely favorites. What makes an ice cream flavor good? That requires a more nuanced exploration, depends on personal preferences, and so much more. That is what REA gives us readers. Thank You!” – David Longley, Arizona, USA\n \"R oom Escape Artist  is the wittiest, most resourceful escape room guide out there. Lisa and David allow enthusiasts to live vicariously through their adventures, giving readers a sneak peek into a wide variety of rooms while somehow not spoiling any of the mystery behind what makes the room so fun to solve on your own. Best of all, in an industry where recommendations are hard to trust,  Room Escape Artist  gives you the tools you need to decide for yourself what room to experience next. – Kate Wastl, Buffalo, NY, USA \n \n“I have nothing but genuine respect and admiration for Lisa and David. I am in constant awe of their endless passion and tireless dedication to the interactive/immersive game industry.” – Tommy Honton, Stash House, Los Angeles, CA, USA \"When I first thought of opening an escape room in July 2015, I did tons of research.  At some point I came across your web-site and subscribed. As I looked through your posts I came across some words you wrote and pinned them to my wall. After what can only seem like an eternity,  we will open our doors this month (February, 2016). Although I haven’t had time to read everything you have written, I wanted to say thank you. Every time I’m in my shop I read through the words and make sure I am following them.\" – Jason Richard, Steal and Escape, San Diego, CA, USA"},

I'm the creator of the webcomics  Twin Dragons  and  Gamer Dragons . Twin Dragons  is a comic about the daily life of a dragon twin, Kai and Kaya Romero. It's a slice of life humor comic about animal hybrids in a predominantly human world and how they interact with each other. Gamer Dragons  is a spin-off from Twin Dragons with the same main characters. In this comic you will see game related jokes and shenanigans with the twin and their friends, all based in well known (or lesser known) games. What is patreon? I could post a lengthy explanation about this, but the following video explains it better than I ever could: Why should I donate? First of all, I want to state that the comics will always be free for everyone to read. No paywall or anything, since I hate that. There will only be extra's through the goals system, and those will be for everyone as well. As much as I like drawing these comics (and believe me, I love it), I need money to pay the bills. I've been in a very blessed situation where I could take the time to build the comic from the ground up and start drawing it, but I need support to keep doing this in the future. Right now, I'm looking at commissions as my only income, and to keep that up, I might not be able to keep both comics running in the future. That's where you loyal fans and great people come in. For as low as 1 dollar a month you could help me continue making you guys happy. Help me to keep drawing comics, and you can get some rewards as well as the satisfaction of knowing you helped me achieve my dream goal of being a full time comic artist. If not for me, do it for Kai and Kaya. Kaya is running dangerously low of chocolate and Kai can't hold her forever. Help Kaya get more chocolate, donate now xD If you buy into the cameo tier, please refer to the  cameo disclaimer."},

I'm Maxine and welcome to my Pin Club! With all the excitement surrounding my enamel pins I wanted a quick and stress-free solution for you to collect my pins. By signing up to my Patreon pin club it takes away the panic of making sure you're at your computer on time or the ever frustrating refreshing pages to see they've sold out. Now you can take all that frustration away by signing up for the monthly pin club and receiving your pins every month without worry of missing out! For the remainder of 2021 I'll be continuing my monthly mermaid pin series. These babies are 2.5 inches, Gold enamel with 2 rubber clutches. I always ensure they are of the best quality by checking each one myself. They come on collectable 4x6 backing cards with the original sketch to one side for those who wish to cut them into 4x4 sketch cards or keep them intact for your collection. These are a fun way to see the original vision next to the finished product. All pins also come with the matching sticker! Patreons will also get inside scoops on new designs and color schemes. Now the important info: Please select the tier based on where you located. These have specific shipping rates attached to each tier. Note that when you sign up you will be receiving the following month design (sign up in May, you will receive the June pin). Patreon automatically begins processing payments starting at 12:00 AM \nPST on the 1st. This process usually takes 1 - 5 days. If your payment \nis declined, you will get an email from Patreon asking you to fix your \npayment method. Will I get to see the month's design before I am charged? Yes! I will release the new design on the fourth week of the month before (at the latest). This gives you 7 days to cancel your subscription if you \ndecide you don't want next months pin. I joined in the middle of the month. Does this mean I will receive that month's rewards? No -- Patreon operates on a monthly payment system. When you join, you will receive the following month’s rewards! Example:\n If you pledge on May 15th, you won't be billed until June1st, and \nthe first pin you'll receive is the pin for the month of June. Can I get a refund if I don't like my pin? No. All pin club designs will be shown as a mockup \ndesign this will give you and idea of how it will look, it is upto you to decide if you want to cancel your subscription before the order processes. Please note that the design will be a digital mock up and may change slightly during the manufacturing process. Depending on your screen the colors may also appear differently. Refund Policy I don't offer refunds or cancellations after the 1st of each\nmonth, If you wish to  cancel, you must do so before your payment is processed. I will not refund or replace any lost or damaged items. Please pay for insured shipping to avoid this problem.

My name is  Kels , also known around the internet as  KM Steere,   Keymonster  or just  Key . I am a full time, freelance artist and illustrator working out of the Pacific Northwest. My creative passions center around animals, plants and the fantastical worlds they exist in. I love creating plant/animal hybrids and integrating botanical motifs and imagery into the worlds that I build as well as creating adorable little creatures of all shapes and sizes getting into a bunch of mischief.  I started this Patreon page to give myself a steady income as well as allow my followers to help fund the exploration of new ideas, projects and merchandise. I love being able to interact with followers of my work and Patreon is a nice, centralized place for me to be able to do that without all the clutter of social media channels. As my Lovely Forest grows I will be able to dip my toes into some of these things: Process and Technique Discussion: I generally don't share much about my art making process, mostly because it tends to involve a lot of scribbling and not a lot of technical or program jargon, but I will try to post about parts of my process including references I use, some techniques I have picked up or are currently experimenting with and struggles I'm having with certain parts of being a freelancer. Tutorials are not really my thing but they will pop up from time to time. I should also mention that I love cats, and I love creating art with cats. I often will use cats as the testers for new ideas or techniques for projects, and this platform will give you the opportunity to suggest themes for these cats. I swear I don't have a problem! World Building: I love making worlds in my head. I also love creating fantasy species and races that will go into those worlds. I have a few actually written down (see below) but mostly I love making fae creatures and other magical beings that could live along side us in our world, or exist in their own parallel to ours. Some of the worlds I enjoy building on and creating in are:  Verdant Fae As I mentioned above I love making fae creatures. My idea generally springs from the concept of magic in everything but on a different plain of existence. Fae are the creatures that can channel these magics through themselves to manifest it in the physical world. In my own headcannon fae can include anything from dragons to pixies, foxes to mushroom peoples.   Donair Donair is a fantasy story based on a dream I had a while ago. I wrote everything down and my partner and I became hooked on figuring out little details about the character and how the world worked as well as the idea of potentially turning it into a RPG some time in the future. Donair is based off of elements and how they interact with each other in a world torn apart by dynastic war.  The World of M.E.C.A.   Without going into too much detail M.E.C.A. stands for mechanically enhanced, cybernetic animals, and it is a story revolving around  three siblings, named 001, 002, and 003 , that have been thrust between the  new-world order  and the ways of  Old Gods .   They are in a race against time to learn about and adapt the old ways, or face complete assimilation and obliteration within the literal, modern machine.  Sky Guilds Loosely based off of the theme for a kickstarter I ran in 2017, Sky Guilds is centered around the idea of the different craftsman guilds that create the elements of the sky. You have the Star Painters, Weather Craft, Cloud Shepherds, Moon Phase Spinners, Constellation Alchemy and more!  Many More... I have a ton of other undeveloped worlds that I love building and then just let simmer while more ideas form. It is a constant process.  Print and Merchandise Production: Ever since I discovered that small artists could produce their own products and sell them to their fans I have wanted to do this. The idea of seeing my work out in the wild world always fills me with joy and encourages me to put more out there. Imagine what type of worlds others make with the help of my little critters and magical creations. The idea of all that creativity fills me with joy.  With Patreon support I am able to make things and explore ways to make those things responsibly. The thing with \"stuff\" is that it creates waste and waste is not what the world needs. In product production \"eco friendly\" options are often more expensive or have more limitations in their production process. With the funding support from Patreon I have been able to learn about and use various products in my shop that have a smaller footprint then just the standard production costs.  To Sum it Up: Experimenting and exploring new techniques and ideas takes time, energy and money, which are not always in ample supply. With the help of my Lovely Forest, the financial burden will be lessened allowing me more freedom to create weird and wonderful things to share! I started this patreon page in 2019 and never expected to create a community of such kind, creative and supportive people. It blows my mind every day how much has happened in the years since that first step. I am so excited to see what the future brings and I'm also excited to share it with you all. Thank you so much for your support! You can find my work or follow me through these links:  KM-Illustration.com  •  Keymonster Shop  •  Twitter  •  Instagram  •  INPRNT  (prints) *** Mailed Patreon monthly rewards use as much recycled or plant-based material as possible. The plastic sleeves I use to protect stickers are made from a material called PLA (polylactic acid). In a composting environment it takes about 90 days for this type of plastic to break down. I mail my rewards in recycled kraft paper envelopes and try to use recyclable stock in all my print options. "},

Our patrons are having FUNN at all the levels & we are so appreciative of your support. FUNN friends  have so many ways to participate in bonus content from tutorials, extra videos, extra challenges, and access to our Guest Crafters with questions. It is a super great way to support us and we've tried to make the content, well, really FUNN. FUNN supporters  have all the FUNN friend benefits, plus more control of Craft Roulette's challenges, and a stronger card making teaching component. If you love making cards and want to understand the parameters we use on Craft Roulette, this may be the perfect way to support us. Club FUNN supporters  have all the FUNN friend & FUNN Supporters' benefits, plus an exclusive, extensive, and easy-to-use scrapbooking component. Not only that, we are very community-centric with TWO Zoom calls a month. We have a lot of FUNN getting to know each other through our stories, helping each other, and our Zoom calls. This might be a perfect way to support us if that sounds good. Mentorship Level  supporters get private teaching time about paper crafts, cards, scrapbooking, etc. Mary will review projects, talk to your about your goals, background, and try to help with suggestions, quick tips, and help. This is very limited because of the time commitment and Mary's tendencies to over analyze things.   Sound good? Any and all support sounds good to us. It really means so much to us to have you become a patron at any level and for any time period. THANK YOU. Of course, we appreciate all our viewers who subscribe, give us thumbs up, leave positive comments, participate in our social groups, and share our shows, and Patreon info).

Each week of this year I will be posting a brand new original song, with some notes about the origin and the songwriting and recording process.  As someone who generally moves slowly and cautiously through the subconscious and is absolutely terrified at all times of the consequences, this idea is, in many ways, insane.  But I'm also thinking that perhaps this is the only sane thing to do, since the only place to go on tour at the moment is inside my own mind.  By the end of this year, when I ask myself where the time went, I’ll have no answers, but I’ll have a better understanding of the craft of songwriting, and maybe, hopefully, I’ll understand myself a little better too.

We host the SWLing Post with a professional service with live, on-on-one customer support. We do this so that down time is at a minimum and when any issues arise, they can be solved quickly. We also utilize a robust backup system that archives our entire site--every post and every comment--each time a new article is published. QRPer.com  was started around the same time as the SWLing Post, but focuses primarily on the world of ham radio and, specifically,  low-power amateur radio in the field.  Our goal with QRPer.com is to encourage ham radio operators to hit the field and play radio. Our real-time, real-life videos also provide a means to virtually mentor operators who wish to explore the world of park and summit activations. Our videos have no ads at all--they'll run seamlessly without interruption. Your contribution on Patreon is one way we're able to make this happen.  Your Patreon contribution goes beyond  the SWLing Post & QRPer.com.

My name is Lexi, and I've been designing enamel pins since April of 2018. I've been drawing for most of my life and collecting pins for about 5 years now, and I love running Pinfluential! I get to hone my art skills and learn more and more about drawing digitally, all the while creating designs inspired by anime and cartoons that I love.  \n Rewards \n For all tiers, you receive access to Patreon-exclusive content, polls, and behind-the-scenes sneak peeks at future projects, as well as enter Patreon-only giveaways! For the $3 tier, you also receive access to the Patreon secret shop, where you can purchase previous months’ pins and stickers, as well as a 15% off discount code for my Etsy shop! The secret shop will also have some surprises dropped in there from time to time! These are all exclusive to Patreon members are are not to be shared elsewhere. \n How Patreon Works \n When you pledge, you will be charged upfront! I recommend pledging at the beginning of the month to maximize the amount of time you’ll have your perks. After you pledge, you will be automatically charged on the 1st of every month. Patreon is a subscription service. You can unpledge at any time and will still have access to your perks until the 1st of the next month. In Regards to Past Pin Pledges If you are still waiting on pins that you’ve pledged for, I will still be fulfilling all pending rewards once they finish production! Extras will drop in the secret shop at a later date. ***PLEASE NOTE: Due to COVID-related delays, production time is taking longer than usual. You may receive your rewards a few weeks later than expected. Thank you for your patience! \n \n New Rules Regarding Reselling/Trading (Updated 02/27/2021) \n I realize, looking at my Patreon policies, that there wasn’t an established rule before about reselling Patreon pins. My Patreon pins also weren’t being flipped for a lot of money before, so I didn’t feel the need to make a rule for it, but that rule is being established now: -Patreon pins that are still in stock OR the extras haven’t dropped yet can be sold for what you paid for/the shop price. -Reselling Patreon pins that are in stock/will have extras dropped for more than that will result in a warning the first time. Since this is a new rule, I want to be fair. -Doing this again will result in your removal/ban from my Patreon and secret shop. -I have no issue with people trading Patreon pins. Trade to your heart’s content, y’all. Please respect the new rules I’ve put in place, and think twice about buying any of my Patreon pins that you see on Mercari , Depop, EBay, etc. Feel free to message me with any questions about product pricing or availability if you’re unsure! \n \n Patreon-Exclusive Shop (The Vault) \n The Vault Pledging for secret shop access comes with a password that will give you access to the vault (shoppinfluential.com) for an entire month. The shop link and password will be available to $3 pledgers in a pinned post each month! The password will change monthly, and please do NOT share it with people not in my pin club. If someone isn't a patron and tries to buy from there, I will refund the order. The Vault will have all previous months' pins and stickers 🌟For the LE50 variants of Patreon-exclusives, only one is allowed per person! I will automatically refund duplicates of the same LE pin. \n \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t To see more of my work, you can view it here: \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t \n \n Etsy Shop Instagram \n Facebook \n Twitter"},

And as far as we can tell, the album has done quite well up to today: we entered German album charts at #45, received outstanding reviews and critics and have played some great shows supporting the album. DISILLUSION are back! All of this was a dream come true, a new album after all those years, and would never have been possible without the 200 patrons who have maintained their loyalty and financial support since the very beginning of this Patreon campaign in March 2017 up to today! We will be grateful to you for all eternity! You are incredible!!! \n \nYou may call it a trademark of the band, that each of our songs has a certain depth – musically and emotionally. After producing our “comeback” single ALEA in 2016 it was very clear to us that if Andy were to pursue his regular studio job parallel to writing new Disillusion material, it would take ages to complete a new record. And it also would not be certain if the material would reach that level of musicality that we and you - the fans - expect and want. This is exactly what this campaign is about: enabling Andy to  work full-time  on Disillusion - write the music and create the atmosphere and take care of everything around the band that needs to be done. While the others in the band pursue regular jobs and are dedicating the majority of the free-time to the band, Andy is simply doing the main job. We are serious: without you, all this would not be possible and no benefit, no reward that we think of, can make up for the chance that you give us - we do what we do best: music. But of course, if you decide to join this campaign, you will receive something in return - please read the tiers and benefits for details. … Today in 2021 - admits the worldwide pandemic - we are writing for and working on  THE FOURTH Disillusion Album . And we plan to release it as soon as possible in 2022 and not in some distant future as many fear. To do that as good and even better, we need You! Especially now when there are no shows being played, no money earned at live shows, no or very few merch sold - we need your support to go on! There is a road that we must travel ... together! If you have any question please send us an email to  [email protected]   For now thank You very very much for your interest and time!  Hope to talk to you soon, Andy & Disillusion"},

Selco has been long established in the Urban Preparedness community for many years having gone to great lengths and detail sharing his brutal experiences from the Balkan war and beyond.  Toby joined the team seven years ago and has been pioneering the 'physical' course delivery for the school. Since 2015 SHTFSchool has grown, developed and increasingly been working in partnerships. This has influenced subjects discussed and styles of information delivery in order to respond to the needs of a larger audience and specific demographics. While Toby's public profile has largely been focused on wilderness survival skills, there is also a tremendous amount of knowledge and relevant experience relating to Urban survival matters (mostly related to his time in the Military Intelligence community), which until now he has not been prepared to share.  Now the time has come however to create a place and space that Selco and Toby can dive into the full depth of their experience, opinion and 'what matters' in terms of preparedness and survival. Coupled with this is growth and development into the mainstream sector of overall Resilience and Preparedness.  Subscribers should note that the creation of this page crosses a rubicon in Selco and Toby's work. For the past ten years, lessons shared have been freely available, general in terms and often focused on experiences from the Balkan war. While that content will continue we will now be delivering more specific examples and greater detail, as well as looking at influential events of note in recent times and as they occur, and sharing specifics of our own personal preparedness plans, risk assessment and management strategies, preparedness principles for the individual, business owner and corporate entity, as well as general guidance on a wide range of resilience themes.   Please note this page is not for the faint hearted, easily offended and/or overly opinionated. We are creating a unique environment too share exceptionally hard won knowledge, and unfortunately do not have the time or inclination to try and tread around individuals fragility and sensibilities.  This page is certainly a place you will benefit from listening more than you speak. Rules will be set and followed. For quality assurance subscriber numbers will be strictly limited.  If you really are committed to learn more about Urban Resilience and all that it entails, you'll join us here. All we ask in you ensure you have an open mind and respectful manner before you enter."},

Over my career, I've done a bit of everything including news, features, reviews, lists, walkthroughs, interviews, streams, podcasts, and general hosting.  Currently, I'm an independent game critic and content creator able to do what I do because of Patrons like you! When I'm not  streaming on Twitch  or writing for my own outlet,  Pen to Pixels , I'm on Kinda Funny's PlayStation podcast (PS I Love You XOXO) and MinnMax's flagship podcast (The MinnMax Show). Previously IGN editorial, I also have bylines at outlets such as   Kotaku ,  PlayStation Lifestyle ,  Nerd Much ,  Hard Drive , and more.  I've been independent for a year now and have learned a lot along the way. One thing I'm committed to is growing, adjusting, and improving this Patreon page as I go so that it aligns with my goals as they change and develop.  Currently my goal is to write more about games on Pen to Pixels, bring back content to my person YouTube channel, and continue streaming on Twitch all while continuing my work with KF, MinnMax, and other projects that come across my desk.  ABOUT THIS PATREON Gameonysus is my personal brand (and handle across social media). The name “Gameonysus” (pronunced game-on-uh-sus) is inspired by the name Dionysus (the god of wine). For me, Gameonysus means “god of gaming,” which reflects  my overall goal . This isn’t to say I want to be the greatest gamer in the universe; rather,  I want my gaming experiences and the content I create to  be  a universe :  expansive, beautiful, curiosity-driven, and inspiring . I strive to  play a wide variety of games  and offer  opinions/insights that will benefit and enrich the lives of others. Here are the projects my Patreon is currently supportin g:  Twitch :  Best of 2023 Watch (Friday 3pm PT):  Streaming the biggest releases and the latest games on my radar to determine the best games of any given year: starting now with 2021.  Let's Play (Saturday; 3pm PT) : I want to do more full playthroughs on stream. I'll mostly use this for catching up on games I missed over the years and for playing games my community wants to see me try out. Pen to Pixels : This is my outlet which I started last year. You can expect reviews, previews, features, and lists. YouTube : Opinion videos, news reactions, spotlighting favorites, practical (gaming related) tips, and more.  Articles : I run a content creation and advice blog called  Game Industry Guides .  Building Community : I'm active on  Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok . And you can engage with me and our community more directly by joining  the Discord .  \n \n \t WHY YOU SHOULD JOIN \n If you want to keep seeing my work in the games industry, help me get to the next level, and be part of shaping what that next level looks like, support me on Patreon. Supporting me here means supporting more diverse, in-depth, and creative content. It means building a kind and thoughtful community. It means discovering games you may have otherwise missed. And it means bringing all this directly to you in a way that's as authentic as it is inviting. I'm looking to do more of what I love while adding value to my audience's life through practical info and entertaining content. Your support here will allow me to continue this pursuit, create even more content for all of you, and elevate the production quality of existing content.  Whether or not you choose to become a patron, thank you so much for your time, your views, your shares, and most of all your interaction.

Im a devoted student in the ways of; emotions, nature, art, music & soul to name a few. Ive found location can be a crucial key to unlocking these essentials.    Fortunately for me, I was blessed by the luck of the draw. Born in Lake Tahoe California I was granted with an appreciation for nature at infancy. Even now the smell of the pine trees is forever engraved in my senses. Relaxing me, grounding me, reminding me, to just slow down and breathe. In times of stress, anger, depression or anxiety, I believe spending some alone time in a large body of water, can be the best natural medicine. Knowing these healing properties of our precious lake, only sparked a curiosity to find more of earths ancient truths. Ive walked the deserts of Egypt, scuba dived in the Caribbean, sang karaoke in Japan & danced the night away in Paris.   I tell you that, to tell you this. The connection between all those moments was human. Regardless of location, I was able to interact with all walks of life. They embraced me, taught me, protected me, as well as changed me in ways I cant describe. I will say however, at the core of our hearts, we all long for connection and acceptance. One of the best ways to express these feelings, is also one of the best ways to unite the masses. MUSIC. The universal language rooted into the very fabric of a soul. You know what it is, you know what it means to you, but like most of us you cant always find the words that speaks your truth. Music unapologetically holds every thought or emotion you have ever had and never had.    I understand the importance of that legacy. I want to do my best to add to an already vast world of inspiration. My hopes is that I can make music from the heart, that will speak to the soul. We're all in this together, learning thru living. Let's communicate, let's elevate, let's educate, let's celebrate our blessings & rebuild our Community together. [That's Love]"},

We are discussing multiple interesting topics, and we learn a lot from each other. Please check out the Forum at this web address, if you are curious:  http://wespenreproductions.boards.net/  . Another exciting feature for Tiers 3 and 4 Patrons is having access to a private Discord server where we all can discuss topics with each other in real-time at any time. I also offer a live bi-monthly (text) chat session so we may all stay connected and get to know each other, support each other, and catch up on the events of our lives and the world stage. I wrote a\nlong series of papers a few years ago that has become very popular. They can\nbe found at wespenre.com. They contain research into our true ancient history as I see it,\nand I spent a lot of effort reading and interpreting ancient texts. I noticed\nthat they all presented the same story, even though they were from different\nparts of the world and separated from each other.  \n\nBy cross-checking references, a new and very interesting\npicture showed up, and eventually, I noticed that by getting a fuller picture,\nit answered a lot of the questions I had; not only about our past, but also about our\npresent and our potential future.

Meal Magazine  is an independent print publication featuring thought-provoking food writing and striking art direction. Based in Minneapolis,  Meal Magazine  is produced by a small team of experienced writers, critics, and artists who are passionate about the power of food and drink to bring people together. We seek out and publish diverse stories that give us insight into this strange human experience, using food as our primary vehicle.  Meal  features stories from across the world that examine the social life of food through deep investigative journalism, personal essays, colorful profiles, and thoughtful original art and photography.  Meal  tells provocative stories that will stick with readers for years to come. And while  Meal  is a magazine about food and drink, it also looks to challenge the very notions of what “food writing” is, and who “food writers” are. It is a platform for moving and unconventional storytelling that features unique and diverse voices, resulting in a publication that uses food as a vehicle for exploring the critical issues of our time.  Meal  is for food lovers and anybody who enjoys getting lost in a good story. The debut issue  of Meal Magazine was published in January, 2020.  Issue #2  arrived in January, 2021. Issue #3 is up next, to be published in January 2022. From now on, Meal will be a bi-annual volume, with Issue #4 expected to arrive in June 2022.  When you join our Patreon at any level, you will we subscribed to Meal Magazine, and receive each issue right when it's published. In addition, you'll get our bi-monthly newsletter with updates on magazine production, original writing, and generally be on the inside of what our team is up to -- including being invited to special Patron-only events, and other fun stuff. For each issue, our editorial and art team gathers the best food-centric writing, art, and commentary we can create and curate. We love the tactile, analog quality of a great magazine—it’s something to hold and sink into, to toss in a backpack or place on a bookshelf, to forget about and return to years later. In between each issue of the magazine, we will bring you along for the ride as we share videos, photos, livestreams, public hangouts, and more. Throughout the year, we'll also be working with our favorite chefs, bartenders, partners and brands to produce knockout food-centric events. Think: a surprise underground cocktail party in an unlikely location. An intimate ticketed dinner with a famous chef in someone's backyard. A game of horseshoes in the park with a local BBQ master helming the smoker. Special behind-the-scenes tours of a mushroom farm, brewery, or sports stadium. We've got some wild ideas, and we're gonna create some special experiences. WHO ARE WE? Meal Magazine's team  is founder and editor-in-chief Peter Sieve, co-founder and executive editor Joshua Page, executive editor Molly Each, editor-at-large Mecca Bos, developmental editor Letta Page, art director and designer Jake Luck, and co-art director and photographer Bill Phelps. \n WHY DO WE NEED YOU? \nCreating a magazine is a bold endeavor, particularly when we are committed to paying contributors fairly and putting out a beautiful periodical that we—and you—will want to feature prominently in your homes and workplaces. And while we are seeking the support of some like-minded businesses, we really don’t want to overly fill the magazine with ads. Our patrons are our core financial support, helping us pay contributors and plan the printing and distribution costs of the magazine in advance. Besides simply being our collective sugar daddies, we greatly value the community we're building together here. You're always behind the scenes with us.  Being a Meal patron means you're part of our growing community – we want to bring you into our circle, exchange thoughts and ideas with you in person, and give you some cool rewards in return. Thanks so much for being here—we're excited to continue creating something special with your help!"},

I love subverting people’s expectations of the kind of people who stitch, and of the kinds of subjects cross stitching will be about. I love it every time someone does a double take at seeing a man cross stitching in public, and I love knowing I just jabbed a little needle into the eye of the patriarchy.  I started making my own patterns a few years ago, originally on graph paper with pencils. When my bag was stolen out of my car and with it all my irreplaceable patterns, I decided to go digital. Once people saw my patterns they started asking to buy them. I put together a little e-commerce store with a couple patterns and I was off. I'd like to be able to dedicate more time to making patterns, and Patreon seemed like a good way to connect with people who are in this same journey.  I had to teach myself most of what I've learned about cross stitching, so I decided to start sharing that knowledge. During the great Quarantine of 2020, I started a YouTube channel to help others get started in the art form I love so much. I think it’s important to give back, so I always have a couple of patterns (and often my most popular) that I give away all the proceeds from. I’ve given several hundred dollars to the Utah Coalition against Sexual Assault (UCASA.org) and to the Semicolon project this way. I love my craftivism community, and I plan to integrate my Patreon network into similar future projects."},

I am an irish artist and writer probably best known for the creation of the Magick and Divination system called  The Forty Servants  , which I both designed and illustrated, and  my comics such as  THE HOLY NUMBERS  and  THEM . \n If you want to know more about my background and where I come from then you can check out the About Section of my website  HERE . I'll not fill this page with a huge block of text that most of you will skip anyway :D \n \n Magick = Art? \n To me, Magick and Art are pretty much interchangeable ideas, or at the very least, next to impossible to separate. Magick is creativity; Art is Creativity. Magick is self-expression; Art is Self-expression. Both draw their inspiration from the primordial chaos; both are transformative in nature. Magick is an idea; Art is an idea.  Their final medium of expression may be different (one is your life the other could be a photograph) but the feel is the same. The transformative aspect is the same. The created sense of wonder is the same.  Magick, creating, and art are so intrinsically embedded within who I am as a person that I don't really know when one bit starts and the other ends.  But, with your help, these are the areas I want to explore!  \n \t \n \n \n Why Pledge?* \n \n Good question - why should you give me your money?  First off, to save any future confusion, I want to say that this Patreon is best viewed as NOT being a premium membership to a website or podcast or whatever. It's not really a subscription service where you pay a monthly subscription fee, then you get a product each month for being a member.  It's not really about you getting \"stuff\". It's about you helping me.  What it is instead is about you supporting me so that I can continue to make art, which right now is mostly my new comic  TURBINE SYNDROME , but there is a lot of other stuff I do - podcast, videos etc. There is no real end product that you get and I'm not selling you anything each month if that makes sense. I hope it does.  You send me your hard earned cash every month and I use that money to continue to make art.  The money that you pledge also goes towards paying for website and podcast hosting fees, it pays for better equipment and materials, and it allows me to get better software, and all that goodness that makes it possible for me to  level up ! \n So, it basically comes down to this: If you like what I do and would like to see me do more of it then you should pledge at whatever level you feel comfortable with. If you are looking for a premium membership deal where you get stuff every month then I will advise you to spend your hard earned cash elsewhere, as that's not really what this is.  NOW, with that all said, you do get some cool stuff if you do decide to pledge.  \n Depending on the reward tier you choose, you will have access to some or all of the following:  \n \t First to see and read the  new chapters of Turbine Syndrome ! See exclusive work-in-progress posts and videos on all future art! \t \t First access to any new Limited Edition Art\tPrints! \t \t All\tmy comics in PDF format available for immediate download. \t Digital Printable Version of the Deck. \t \t THE JOURNEY- A year-long Shadow Working using Servitors.12 Monographs and 12 Exclusive Downloadable and Printable Servitor \tartworks. \t \t\t Exclusive extra videos and podcasts, including the STUDY GROUP (Liber Null, The Quickening, the Runes, and  A Story Waiting to Pierce You ). \t We have a discord group where we discuss Magick and related topics. \t PDF version of the \tGrimoire of The Forty Servants. \t \t\t I only offer full divination readings for Patrons. \t Executive Producer Credit on Podcast and Videos. \t Exclusive videos and audios just for Patrons \t Access to the Patreon Only posts. \t Access to the Patreon Only Community. \t Patron level access\tto the AIWW Discord Server. \t And more as time goes on. \n \n And of course, there are already lots of exclusive videos, drawings, posts and whatnot already posted here for patrons just waiting for you to delve into.  So, if that sounds like something you are into, then sign up!  \n *Please note that you only have access to any new rewards if you are subscribed to my Patreon page at the time they are released. Which means that you can download (and keep forever) what is already currently available for you reward tier, but if you stop donating then you will not have access to any of the future rewards.

I'm Geeta. I'm a writer focusing on the outer reaches of music and culture. I've written thousands of articles and reviews on a wide range of subjects, ranging from electronic music to art to neuroscience to robotics, for major publications including  The Guardian ,  Rolling Stone ,  Wired ,  Slate ,  Spin ,  The New York Times ,  The Boston Globe , and  Frieze . I also wrote a critically acclaimed book about Brian Eno called Another Green World.  The current economics of journalism -- with its emphasis on clickbait and maximizing page views -- is hostile to those of us who specialize in long, cerebral explorations of the fringes of human endeavor. I can keep doing high quality writing about music, if the readers who care about this stuff pitch in.  Supporting my work on Patreon gains you access to a growing archive of intriguing materials I've written, which have never been seen before. Some of these you can unlock on my Patreon page, and others -- like lengthy interviews with key figures in music -- can be read on a secret section of my website, using a password that will be sent to you:  http://theoriginalsoundtrack.com/exclusive-material/ Unearthing the fascinating history of electronic music -- from the 1940s onwards -- is my specialty. I've gone out of my way to do interviews with hundreds of composers, artists, and musicians. I've interviewed synthesizer inventors, hackers, and famous science fiction authors. You can read through some of the hundreds of articles I've written on a wide variety of subjects  here . The common thread running through all of my best work is that I've always taken the path of  most  resistance -- to go several steps further, to dig deeper than what's readily available. To not just repeat what's already out there, but to add new research to the world, and new ideas.  Support smart, creative, thoughtful writing on music!"},

A long, long time ago, I thought I was an illustrator. And that’s all I wanted to do. Draw and paint. Then I put all that down and started a band and for a long, long time, that was all I did and all I thought I wanted to do.  A couple years ago, the need to draw came back and the music stayed along with it.  The combination of these two loves of mine has grown into an idea of something bigger, more panoramic. I thought about the old-school fan clubs of yore. The Marvel Secret Society with its loot bags of comic goods sent to members with a secret society pin.  I thought about the amazing music performances on Midnight Special, early MTV and the crazy fun shows and personalities. Pee Wee’s Playhouse and his never-ending knocks on the door and all the cool and diverse guests that showed up.  Finally, I remembered this old Ramones comic I had that featured cartoons of all the great NYC punk bands from the late 70s and faux ads and terribly funny love advice.  These are my favorite things.  Art loot. Musical junk food.  Getting turned on to new music and artists and telling everyone who would listen about them. So I said to myself, building the community. A place to turn people on to cool stuff.  Quit complaining that there isn’t anything cool or fun on the internet anymore and, instead, be the change I wanted to see. So, welcome to Natkins’ Funhouse!  This will be an ever-changing and expanding space for our community.  Like an interactive magazine with my comics and pieces, featuring some of the interesting artists that I meet and want you guys to get hip to.  I have a lot of ideas and I like to work fast! I’ve never been comfortable waiting on some powers that be to dictate what I can create and when I can create it.  Lucky for me, I have you guys!  I never get over the love and support you show to my art and to my music.  That’s the real stuff right there!  Sometimes when I hear things like “oh I don’t wanna fangirl out, but I love you” and you get all embarrassed, seriously, that’s the real stuff that keeps us artists going and thriving!  It’s the thing I am most grateful for. To be seen, appreciated, enjoyed.  And that's mutual! I appreciate and enjoy your feedback, your comments, your posts about the stuff I make. I'm grateful for every single one of you that enjoy my art and music and weird sense of humor and it just makes me want to make more for you!  In the past we’ve made albums together. Secret shows. Hell, you guys even helped us get our Vanna White touring vehicle, and we used that thing to get to all of our shows to over the last ten years!  Together, we get shit done and it’s working! It's fun!  So, with this Patreon site and within the framework of the Natkins Funhouse community, let’s kick it up a notch, make some great things together, learn some stuff about each other, make some new friends, and I’ll do my best to keep you all entertained and inspired! Also, I'm a big fan of surprises, so no matter what tier you choose to support on, everyone is in the mix for monthly contests and random surprises in the mail! I feel like this is the part where the Wizard of Oz turns to color. And it is. Let’s go!"},

PIANO TUTORIAL videos are similarly made in response to viewers needing help, usually with advanced works.   COMPOSERS send new compositions and, when possible, I record their music so they are able to share their work online and on CD.  HARMONIC PIANO PEDAL recordings and demonstration videos can be found on my channel: YouTube.com/PaulBartonPiano and also two channels dedicated to the harmonic pedal:  YouTube.com/Harmonic PianoPedal (English language) and YouTube.com/LaPedaleHarmonique (French language)   WILDLIFE ART videos documenting the main stages in the sculptures of Khwan Barton can be seen at YouTube.com/KhwanBarton (English language)  YouTube.com/Thai language) ART videos documenting the main stages in my paintings can be seen on my channel:  YouTube.com/PaulBartonArt  These videos are embedded on my website  www.PaulBartonArtist.com THANK YOU for taking the time to read this message.

Both of us entered this world with stamina for relational honesty, play, and learning, and we have had our paws in many different disciplines and projects to that end.  \n \nAnimist Arts is the big nest where both our individual and collaborative work lives, including but not limited to: podcasts, articles and blog posts, tutorials, visual art, ritual performances, courses, community research, intensives and workshops, and individual and group consultation.  \n \nAnimism for us is the felt sense that everything, all bodies, all phenomena, are imbued with Spirit and exist in living, interdependent webs (with specific contexts) of creation and destruction. This includes non-corporeal bodies such as ancestors, beliefs, and ideas that exert influence on our bodies, actions and cultures. All of our ancient ancestors were animists, even though that term is more modern.  \n \nIt’s called Animist “Arts” for a reason. We have been tracking the intersections of creative expression and the metabolization of energy and events stored in the body for a long time, and there’s no doubt about it, artistic animist process is at the core of it all. The combination of play and prayerful presence held in the right container can make the process of transformational growth subtly (or not so subtly) exquisite. We think this is what made our wisest ancestors so resilient and ingenious in their lives, and we aim to welcome that lineage to affect the times that we are in now.  \n \nSo here we are, combining our knowledge in neurobiology, complexity science, embodiment, community organizing, artistic practice, contemplative and subtle sensing disciplines, and more to steward the development of effective animist social technologies. All while living inside of capitalism! \n \nAnd that’s where Patreon comes in. There are several tier options to choose from: Become a  root tender  at $5/month Become an  abundance fairy  starting at $10/month -These first two will get you access to all the writing, pop up practices, podcasts/interviews, art, and whatever else decides to happen through the Patreon Join our  Animist Arts Playground  $50-120/month -get access to approx. 4 lives classes a month, a growing library of recordings, and an online community through Thinkific, in addition to all the other stuff we mentioned above \n\n \n We are not “guaranteeing” any particular thing at any particular frequency. We are animist artist-practitioners, which means in order to do what we do well, we have to be listening to deeper rhythms. The gifts come when they come, there is no forcing. We also both navigate chronic pain and fatigue, and we’re not interested in exacerbating our conditions.  \n \nOne major project that this patreon is helping to fund is the ongoing creation of a completely by-donation, self-paced streaming animist arts foundations course called Between Sun and Moon.  \n \nThis course will be the answer to the reality of providing a baseline training for complete “beginners” as well as fill in any gaps for people in how to actually practice the skills we are guiding to private clients. The two of us with our health conditions cannot honestly provide the amount of one-on-one time with teaching that is requested of us, and there is currently no other organized open-source access to this kind of cross-contextual, non-appropriative training available today. We are creating access to a body of practice that took us both two lifetimes to figure out, given the bereft society we grew up in.  \n \nThere has never been an accessible trauma-conscious body of training that foregrounds animism, art making, queerness, mixed race ness, neurodivergence, somatics and attachment dynamics. This is how we give back to the spirits, ancestors, teachers and mentors that have nourished our lives and sanity.  \n \nP.s. If you want to make a lump sum donation rather than monthly recurring donations, please divide the sum in half and send to  www.paypal.me/daresohei  and  www.paypal.me/larissakaul \n \n If you'd like to see what else we are doing, including one-one-one and group sessions, our personal websites are  www.larisskaul.com  and  www.bodyaltar.org \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"},

Now, I want to make art  for  you and  with  you on Patreon! Sign up now to get a little piece of metal art each month in the form of a limited-edition enamel pin! \n \n \n The Plan  \nMy Patreon page is aimed to be something that can be sustained year after year with the format evolving as time goes by. I am starting with a Pin of the Month format that will hopefully grow into a few more tiers and options over time. \n \nPatreon is a crowdfunding platform; however, instead of pledging to support one specific project or idea, you are helping to support and gain access to an ongoing creation. By becoming a monthly patron, you are not only showing your support for me as an artist, but you are also helping to give me the freedom to create and produce more artwork than ever before.\n \n \n \n\t \n \n \n The Pins \nI am sharing a long-time passion of mine: collectable enamel pins. I have been amassing pins ever since I was a little girl when my mother, an Olympian, took me to the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. After growing a sizable collection, I longed to make pins of my very own—and now, thanks to your amazing support, I have finally been able to make that dream a reality! \n \nMy pins start inside my sketchbook and then become large-scale illustrations before being transformed into pin designs. Each design is made in a custom process which allows us to retain an extraordinary level of detail and to evoke the unique life of the original drawing. After line-art, colors, and other details are finalized, each pin is hand manufactured to our custom specifications. Every color in every cell must be filled by hand with enamel, baked in large kilns, and polished flat. After that, we assemble each one onto a unique backer card, bag them up, and ship them out to each of our collectors!\n \n \n \n\t \n \n \n What will you get?  \n \nDifferent levels of monthly subscriptions are available, depending on how much you wish to contribute as a Patron.  For now, there are two levels: \n \n \n A $1/month pledge  gets you exclusive access to an inside look at my pin creation process, monthly updates and coloring pages featuring my new designs, as well as exclusive product releases available for purchase before the general public. \n \n A $15* month pledge  gets you access to the pin of the month, along with all the benefits of the lower tier. Once a month, you will be mailed an original, high-quality, enamel pin of my own design.  \n \n\t *For international buyers, a $25 pledge is required to account for trackable shipping outside the United States and and its territories. Failure to select this higher amount may result in your spot being forfeited. \n \n \n\t \n \n \n \nWelcome Package \nWe love growing our crazy pin family! As a way to introduce you to our pins, we give each new Pin-of-the-Month member** ($15 for US/$25 for international) a Welcome Package with your first shipment. The Welcome Package includes: \n\t One Printed Backer Card to use as a fun backdrop for your pin collection. Mount it on your pinboard to give your creatures a scene to live in! \n\t One of our \"Pin Guides\" to help to show you the ropes of the vast pin-collecting universe. \n\t And mystery surprises, like stickers, prints, or magnets! \n \n**Only one Welcome Package per person. Should you leave and rejoin you will not be eligible for a duplicate Welcome Package. This helps us to ensure that everyone receives the welcome they deserve. Thanks! \n \n Pin Details:  \nMost of my designs center around animals, nature, fantasy, myths and legends. I use lots of swirling shapes, rainbow galaxies, and small details. All of the pins that we make are created in this signature artistic style and also feature the following:\n \n \n\t Between 1.25” and 3” at the longest dimension. \n\t \n\tAt least 4 colors with various metal platings (silver, gold, holo, etc). \n\t Hard Enamel or Soft enamel with Epoxy coat. \n\t All of our pin-of-the-month pins are limited edition. This means that a finite number of pins are produced for each design which will not be reproduced in the same coloration once they have sold out. \n \n \n    \n \nPatreon Exclusive Content:\n \n \n The monthly pin subscription provides exclusive pins at a significant discount given only to patrons.  I tend to create intricate pins that are priced slightly higher than others on the market because of our level of detail, additional packaging, and innovative processes. \n \nAll pins in the monthly pin subscription will be limited edition based on the number of current members. Only after each patron has received their pin will the remaining pins be available on my website or at conventions at full retail price without the Patreon discount. Some months there may be no leftover pins, making them 100% Patreon-exclusive. Once these pins are made, they will never be remade with the Patreon exclusive colors again.\n \n \nOther exclusive content includes a first look at upcoming pins, process sketches, videos, periodic updates, and more!\n \n \n How does subscribing and billing work? \n \nPatrons are charged at the beginning of each monthly cycle; usually the 1st or the 2nd of each month. You are not locked in by signing up for Patreon. You can cancel at any time, but do note that if you cancel or wish to “skip a month” you acknowledge that you may be forfeiting your spot for the following month if the membership is full. \n \n \nPins will only be shipped after your card is charged at the 1st of the month and will require a few days of packaging and processing, with the goal of having all pins shipped by the 15th of each month. While we aim to have all pins shipped out by the middle of the month, some months may be shipped later due to production delays. This can be due to lengthened time for the creation of a more complex pin or other unforeseen circumstances. But not to worry! If you have paid for a month, you will receive your pin for that month! \n \n \nPlease note that when signing up for Patreon, you are signing up for the \n next  month's pin design and rewards. Teasers will be released at the end of each month so that current patrons can decide whether or not they want to stay subscribed for next month. \n \n \nSo what are you waiting for?  \n\tSign up today so we can begin collecting and creating together!\n"},

We are forged and fired in the crucible of the heart and art gives life and meaning to our stories. My prayer is that I share the right medicine for you and that my words will create a sacred altar reflecting the beauty, truth, wisdom and justice which is potent and potential in our world. It is your choice how deep you want to journey with Holy Mary.  I offer inspiration through art and altar; sacred pilgrimage, shamanic journeying, ceremonial and devotional practises and initiations into the Hearth of the Temple of Mary as Flamekeepers after having received a spiritual name. The ancient tradition of creating sacred altars used to\nbelong to the Great Mother and her devotees and it was incorporated into\nreligion by the nuns and convents. I call it Sacred Altars and it is my\noffering on the Altar of Life. Twenty years ago I became a pilgrim to sacred\nplaces on the Earth and especially to where the Divine has stepped through the\nveil to reach us and where Mary had appeared to others. I bring waters from the\nholy springs and rivers; I bring back oil and salts sanctified by the Presence\nof the energies at these sacred places. Through the years I have shared all of\nmy pilgrimages with my blog readers and eventually I opened a shop . I bring\nback my own direct experiences and my own transformation and make sacred altars\nwhich I share with others through my shop Her Grace Sacred Art  on my website at  www.hergracesacredart.com My life as a pilgrim to sacred places Pilgrimage and sacred ritual is my foremost spiritual practise. Raised Dutch Reformed Protestant, the rich lustre of sacred and holy places offered a well of inspiration for my parched soul. My travels have taken me to many different religions, cultures and traditions. You will see on the internet that I have written on many aspects of the spiritual journey. Until I came into contact with the mystical side of Christianity. My first ritual I attended was the festival of Archangel Michael in Mont Sant'Angelo in Italy, then visiting Padre Pio. Then followed walking the pilgrimage of Bridgid, the sacred well and labyrinth in Kildare, Ireland. And that is when my art appeared in the form of paintings. Ritual grounded in the knowing of the unconscious, awakens us from the dream of habitual seeing and thinking. The conscious mind lacks the ability or maybe the neural pathway to communicate the new-found wisdom intellectually, and thus the expression through art steps in. Well, that is only my experience and understanding, of course. But I had not been an artist till I participated in sacred ritual. My stay at Lourdes and participating in the rituals daily, turned me into a full time artist. When one participates in a ritual (probably any ritual, but when you regard it as sacred, you add a certain 'light' to it) you are transported into a different time and space : colors are different; the light is different; everything has meaning and the ordinary become extra-ordinary. My art novena for Lourdes in particular, highlights my statement that our lives are the altar to the Divine and I strive to capture that numinosity of the sacred ritual in my photographs and altars. I only started creating sacred altars on my return from Lourdes. These small shadowboxes are vignettes, a moment in time in the life of ordinary human beings, lifted out of the mundane into the numinous, merely by seeing life as sacred. In 2001 I undertook my first pilgrimage to the grotto of Archangel Michael in Mont Sant'Angelo in Italy and participated in the week long festival in honour of the Saint.  In 2002 I founded a wisdom school Freedom through Love and a spiritual healing training centre The Shekinah Healing. In 2007 I\norganised the International Goddess Conference in Franschoek, South Africa.  In 2008 i was initiated into the Siddha tradition as a shaktypat giver  and  guru and after an intense three years i became a devotee to Anandamayi.  I received my spiritual name Sri Bhaktymayi Ma and in 2010 I visited the sacred spring of Lourdes and my devotion to Blessed Mary became more formal as I accepted the name of Hettienne Bhaktymayi Maria Ma. In 2012 I founded the  Temple of Mary  with 12\nflamekeepers, with annual initiations and retreats.  For years I led healing circles, created\nsacred drama, led sacred dance workshops and circles and my work with women groups was featured\ntwice on the SABC (South African Broadcast Company) program Free Spirit.  I wrote a monthly column on Tarot for the national\nmagazine Namaste and offered tarot workshops. These spiritual and creative practises led to the creation of  The Mysteries of Mary tarot deck , published 7 years ago and the  Mysteries of the Black Madonna deck and book and currently I am working on The Mysteries of the Red Madonna deck and book. \n\n \n\nI create from the eye of the heart, rather than the eye\nof the mind and hope to illuminate and show the underlying image and Divine\nPresence in the vignette of our personal stories.

So if you like what you see becoming a patron is a way to support me. As a patron you will receive patron only rewards depending on the tier you are in (see list on the side) for each set of drawings I'm completing. Depending on the method I'm using the number of finished pieces each month will vary. I like to try out new techniques and I really dislike drawing under pressure so I think it's better to support me for the work I have done instead of per month. I will try to go for  3-5  well rendered artworks per set (2 sets per month) .  NSFW versions  will also be drawn for most of them.  If you want to make sure to receive all rewards your monthly limit should be able to cover 2 sets. I usually send out rewards at the 6th-10th of each month. My illustrations are fully colored, you can check out some of them: Tumblr DeviantArt Facebook Twitter Instagram I will also sometimes be livestreaming on Twitch: Zumi's Twitch Stream See you there:D Past rewards  can be found on or through Tier 5 on Patreon."},

I'm Jesse Hamm, cartoonist, essayist, and illustrator. Over the past decade, I've written many essays and tips about cartooning that have received a warm response from thousands of students of the artform -- professionals and amateurs alike. You may have seen my art advice on Tumblr: or my tips on Twitter: or analyses I've written of artists such as Moebius, Frank Frazetta, and Alex Toth: I'm a huge fan of learning more about drawing and storytelling, and I enjoy helping other cartoonists learn more about the wonderful medium of comics. However, since I don't charge for the advice I post online, I rarely have time to delve into a subject as deeply as I (and my readers) would like. This is where you come in.  I would like to write more lengthy, illustrated, in-depth essays about drawing \ncomics. Not \"beginner\" tutorials, of which the market has plenty, nor \nregurgitations of lessons commonly seen, but NEW material, aimed at advanced \nstudents who seek to augment their skills with next-level knowledge.  You can find a thousand books with titles like \"Advanced Algebra,\" or \"Advanced Engineering,\" but there isn't a single book with the title \"Advanced Cartooning,\" and I would like to change that -- one PDF at a time!  I would also like more time to make personal art , both for fun and to hone my skills. Though I spend the most productive hours of my week drawing for a living,  that time is currently spent drawing properties that are not my own. I would like to buy back some of that time, to create art of my own and express my own ideas. I've written a graphic novel which I wish to someday illustrate, but first I'll need to design the characters, creatures, costumes, and locales -- a task requiring many hours at the drawing board, hours I must currently devote to paid assignments. If you patronize my efforts, you will help me create illustrated, in-depth essays through which I can share my knowledge of cartooning with you and other comics enthusiasts.   You will also enable me to carve time out of my work schedule to hone my skills and create original new art.  Your patronage will result in art and writings that represent the best of what I have to offer, material that would not otherwise exist outside my head.  Please help me bring wonderful new things into the world!"},

My characters are predominantly fantasy girls with the not-so-occasional pointed ears and horns. I wasn't always working as an artist.  For the first half of my life I was told art wasn't a career and quit doodling even as a hobby. It wasn't until three years ago when I discovered the world of digital art and fantasy characters that I decided I wanted to chase a new dream. I worked two jobs while I taught myself art; it was an immensely challenging situation that I think was key in developing my work ethic as an individual. Now I channel that energy into patreon and encouraging others to follow their dreams.  I work full-time as a digital artist and spend every week with the community in the form of livestreaming.  I believe creativity is possible in anyone . The person who tells you otherwise simply can’t imagine a beautifully painted future - a future I  know  you’re more than capable of painting for yourself given the right tools. Whether you are an art collector, a hobbyist or someone looking for a career in art I hope that, if nothing else, this page leaves you feeling inspired to embark on your own creative adventure. I'm right here with you. \n\t These are a few of the things you can expect to see as part of joining us here: \n\t ‣  LIVESTREAMING ON TWITCH I spend a lot of time with my community! Some artists are difficult to connect with but I never want to feel out of reach. We're family here - all growing together in a creative community; shouldn't we spend it on a platform that allows for real time chat? ‣  CREATIVE MINDSET COACHING - This course isn’t the standard “learn to draw” roadmap - we go deeper than that. Yup, we are going to poke that creative brain of yours. We will bust through your art block and get to root of why you feel stuck as an artist, together, so that we can begin to paint the beautiful future you deserve. Depending on the course level you choose, you'll have access to individual 1-on-1 sessions with Sylessae that can include feedback, paint overs, instruction and even breakdown of your creative schedule. ‣ DAEMON ANIMAURAS SERIES Daemon Animauras is a series based on strong fantasy female characters. Each girl is defined by the features of a single animal, interpreted in a way that best represents my style and imagination. Characters blend within snippets of story to invoke a sense of wonder while viewing each painting. Each girl will be available as a limited edition print through patreon; as for a larger project (like an art book or zine) once the collection is completed, that is yet to be determined. ‣ CRYSTALS SERIES Are you surprised? Another series based on ladies, only this time we're showcasing girls with the properties of beautiful, rare crystals. Their stories unfold around the mysticism and wonder of gems, finding beauty where others might see a simple stone. \n\t ‣ SKETCHES & ILLUSTRATIONS Sketches often keep me busy between larger projects!\nThe illustrations, however, are the big projects with a focus on color and characters. Still, I'm always reaching out and learning new things to improve. Generally, all of the work here is original.  ‣ YOUTUBE Our youtube channel is currently a work in progress. We're learning as we go and providing content that's intended to bring a little positivity into your own processes and creations. Your support funds each video and hey, they'll even be released to you before everyone else! When I'm not painting, streaming or drinking coffee, I also like to talk to my plants and take naps with my cat. ★ Become a patron today to join our cozy art community. You will not be charged immediately; instead, you will be charged on the first of every month! Rewards are sent out via patreon message on the 5th.

My name is Cobus (pronounced \"kwuh-biss\", other notable examples include \"Quebec\" & \"Quidditch\"). I started making videos of me drumming along to my favourite songs more than 14 years ago (long before it was cool) and uploading them to YouTube (long before you could make ANY money with it) and since then this has turned into the most amazing journey of my life so far, including moving from a small town in South Africa to Los Angeles to pursue music full time -  all entirely thanks to YOU. I absolutely love playing the drums, connecting with people the world over, and eating cheese. \n YouTube  |  Facebook  |  Instagram  |  Twitter \n Why I'm Here The video above explains things pretty well, so I'll keep this simple: Patreon will make it possible for me to release more videos, more consistently, as well as  connecting more with you guys  to find out exactly what kind of content you want to see. I LOVE THIS. It's been a long time coming and I'm very excited! Since I do everything myself (set-up, tuning, miking, recording, mixing, editing, etc) it makes it very time-consuming (and expensive!) to produce high quality videos, which means I can only really do it every few months. I am hoping that Patreon makes it possible for me to do this WAY more often: with the goal being to upload a new video  every week . Where Your Money Goes Right now, your money will quite literally go towards me  paying rent and buying food . I'd love to be able to rent a practice/rehearsal studio where I can leave my drums, cameras, and recording equipment set up all the time - so I can make more videos more often. If things go well and more patrons sign up, it will make it possible to UPGRADE to higher quality videos, bigger productions, more diverse content, and more community-focused projects (like the YouTube Band Project, or the Re-Cover Music Project).  How It Works You have  COMPLETE control : you can have a look at the reward tiers, pick what you want, and pledge that amount per month.  Your support will quite literally make it possible for me to make more of the videos you guys want to see, as well as connecting with you regularly, so I can't thank you enough. See you on the inside!"},

I'm Lucy. \n \nYou might know me from \n Lucy's Corsetry on Youtube , where I am tantalizingly close to 100,000 subscribers. I also run the educational corset blog  Lucy's Corsetry  (which is the most comprehensive corset blog currently) as well as the (comparatively-dry-but-nevertheless-nifty)  Corset Database . \n \n I've worked hard to organize and shine light on over 350 corset makers and brands all over the world. I create 100% free educational content on how to make and wear corsets safely, and try my best to bring together our amazing community. \n \nI started this Youtube journey in late 2010 by reviewing pretty things. It was almost impossible to find detailed, objective, constructive reviews of corsets on Youtube at the time - so \n I spent well over $20,000 of my own funds purchasing and reviewing hundreds of different corsets.  Turns out, I had enough info to make a  literal database about corsets ! \n \nMy job description isn't quite clear. I'm part corset maker, part teacher, part wearer, part consultant.\n \n \n\t Sometimes brands will hire me to teach their employees more about their own products, so I'm a traveling educator. \n\t Sometimes fledgling corset makers will ask me how their corsets measure up to \"industry standard\", so I act like an appraiser and consultant, setting Quality Control. \n\t Sometimes I work as a liasion between corset makers and their clients, helping people find their \"match\". \n \n Some call me the Corset Ambassador , and that works for me! \n \n One of my proudest achievements  is working with thousands of other corset enthusiasts in our community to create the compilation ebook  Solaced: 101 Uplifting Narratives about Corsets, Well-Being, and Hope . This book gives a peek into the world of medical corsetry: where people in emotional or physical pain use corsets therapeutically to improve their lives. (But it needs an updated cover and better internal layout before it becomes a paperback book, and your patronage will help with that!) \n \n I also happen to have ridiculously long hair  (it grazes the back of my calves) and I love to get nerdy about haircare, nutrition and wellness. I occasionally make science-heavy videos about how hair (and hair products) work, getting into nutrition and the workings of the body. \n \n \n How Would Your Patronage Help? \n \nMy channel used to be far more active than it is now. I used to upload 3x a week and effortlessly keep my site up to date. I have been forced to make less content now due to a tightening of resources. (I spend more time working to be able to afford to continue making videos.)\n \n \nIt would be a gift and an honor to continue making free videos, blog posts, and more, but it's getting harder to do what I love.\n \n \nYoutube only pays me 10% what they used to back in 2014 due to their changes in algorithms and advertiser crisis (commonly known as the \"adpocalypse\"). It's a good month if I manage to earn $5 from a new Youtube video that might have taken me 12+ hours to research and create from start to finish. Older videos earn pennies. This passion does not pay for itself.\n \n \nReviews and sewing tutorials require that I have the funds to buy corsets, materials and other corset making tools and supplies.\n \n \nI have never spent a single penny on advertising or marketing for Lucy's Corsetry - I prefer to pour my funds right back into the community by hosting giveaways and giving back to the people who have supported me most over the years. I'm proud to say that Lucy's Corsetry has exclusively grown from word-of-mouth. Alas, I cannot survive on kind words alone. I have also \n never accepted payment for any corset review, ever. \n \nThere is no requirement for you to help keep Lucy's Corsetry Youtube channel and website afloat, but your patronage would mean a world of difference.\n \n \n Here's what your contribution would do for the future of Lucy's Corsetry: \n \n \n\t More corset videos, more often \n\t More hair, nutrition and health videos \n\t Bringing back sewing tutorials \n\t Funding corsets to continue making free reviews \n\t Funding research (affording to buy Pubmed papers, etc) so that my educational hair, nutrition and health videos are as accurate and up to date as possible \n\t Funding a better microphone, lighting, etc to make higher quality content \n\t Funding stock photos, other media, and possibly hiring an editor to make my videos even better and more fun to watch! \n\t Keeping my website / blog up to date, and keeping the galleries, tools, and and other research resources updated, swanky, and free to use (do you remember the  Corset Designer Doll?  It's been broken for years because I can't afford to update it) \n\t Keeping the  Corset Database tool  ad-free and free to use (also moving it to a new host in order to make it faster and hopefully stop breaking T-T ) \n\t Funding professional photo shoots of my corset collection, for blog articles and future publications \n\t Hiring help to answer your questions faster \n\t Hiring a graphic designer and editor to finally get my book released in paperback \n\t And quite honestly, your help will help bring me and my loved ones more security so we stop worrying about the bills and the future, and start focusing more time and creative energy on what we do best! \n \n \nEven if you choose not to donate, thank you for reading this far! And if you choose to become a patron, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for keeping this passion a possibility for me. I hope to pay it forward multifold by continuing to support this amazing community.\n \n \nLearn more at \n Lucy's Corsetry  (website), my  Youtube channel , and  Corset Database . :)"},

I'm Gemma Chambers, I've been making art and drawing tutorials for Youtube since 2020. My videos have helped thousands of artists improve their skills and create realistic, professional drawings they can be proud of. I like to draw in a realistic style and I've spent years of trial and error and practice to develop my own approach and method to my drawings, and this is now what I teach in my videos.  I've set up this Patreon page for those that want to take their learning further - with longer, much more in depth projects you can follow at your own pace. ⠀ My Tutorial Style ⠀ I firmly believe that drawing should be a joy, something you can do to unwind or to make your free time more enjoyable - This is an important part of how I lay out my tutorials. I break each video down into multiple chapters. At the start of each chapter, I run through the main things that will come up - the colours we're looking for, the techniques I'll be using and generally what we're looking to achieve by the end of the chapter. Then, I hand over to you with the real time footage so you can draw along with me while listening to music or an audiobook, watching TV, talking to family, or whatever you like! You're safe in the knowledge I'm not going to suddenly jump in with more narration until we start the next chapter. ⠀ Project Variety ⠀ I want my tutorials to be accessible and enjoyable for everyone. I draw a variety of subjects including wildlife, people, botanical, still life and much more to keep things interesting. If you're a complete beginner, I have a series of introduction videos to each material to get you started, as well as shorter 'quick win' drawings and technique videos where I cover one particular aspect like drawing hair, eyes or fur. These lessons help build up your confidence to jump into the bigger projects. Typical Project Length: Technique or Quick Win: 1-4 hours Bigger Projects: 5-10+ hours ⠀ Cancel Any Time ⠀ Patreon is a flexible platform, you can make changes to your subscription at any time. You can upgrade/downgrade between subscription tiers to access those benefits, and there are no minimum contract lengths. If you decide Patreon is no longer right for you, you can cancel your pledge and keep your access until the end of the billing month, where you will not be charged again."},

I've had a lifelong love of comic books, and used to run IndieReviews back in 2006, which was a website looking at small press comics in the UK. Now I work as a video editor and cameraman in between busy bouts of reading comics! I also edit the two-time Eisner-nominated monthly comics magazine,  PanelxPanel. \n \nI started 'Strip Panel Naked' because I wanted to see more in-depth analysis on comics and comic art. The response has been amazing, and has already started fostering more discussion. I also break down interesting comic pages on my Twitter ( @HassanOE ) as part of furthering that conversation. \n \n What is 'Strip Panel Naked'? \n'Strip Panel Naked' is a video series analysing and breaking down comics art in detail. \nA lot of artists and writers in comics are often working with invisible tools. Controlling eyelines, reading speed, the way you understand character relationships and action. It's a very unique art form, because like cinema it's entirely visuals-based, but unlike cinema, you don't have as much direct control on your audience. You have to utilise a lot of clever tricks to get your audience to do what you want them to, without it ever really feeling forced.\n \n \n\n \nThat's what 'Strip Panel Naked' is all about. Each video is around 5-10 minutes, focusing on a particular issue and theme within that issue. That way we can really look in-depth at what and how the artist/writer/creative is doing.\n \n \nSo I've looked at topics such as  Declan Shalvey Creating a Good Action Comic ,  David Aja's Panel Density , and how  Chris Samnee Controls Movement . A few times a week I also do breakdowns of interesting comic pages I've noticed. These are found on twitter ( @HassanOE ) but archived on this page, too. \n \n Why Patreon? \nI don't have ads on my videos, and I don't really like the idea of creating a paywall to stop people viewing them. What I'm offering instead is additional content for subscribers. There's a chunk of research that goes into each video, and a lot of other notes and information I end up having to cut for time. \n \n \nI also get a lot of suggestions from viewers about future content, and all those notes, reading lists and research will be made available - so we can, as a community, keep the discussion going.\n \n When Do You Release Content? \n At the moment I'm releasing about two episodes a month on average. \n \n How Do We Help? \n This started because I wanted to have these kind of discussions about comic art with other people. I want to help showcase these great things that artists and writers are doing in books, and have an open discussion about understanding the medium. Hopefully, together, we can help people move from enjoying an issue of a comic, to really understanding why they did. \n \nAnything you can donate, whatever amount, goes into allowing more time to make these videos. From research, to editing, to creating the additional content. I really want 'Strip Panel Naked' to help foster conversation about the medium, and help myself and others get a deeper understanding of it all. \n \n Cheers! \n \n"},

These are the same lessons that have worked for me and for my students. And I want very much to share them with you. I believe we humans are a race of artists... And that no one does it alone... And I believe, when artists are allowed to step into their full potential together, they can change the world.

I've been bringing people's fairy dreams to life since 2003 and had no idea this would become my full time career, but now I can't really imagine doing anything else.   My work has been featured in ways I thought I could only dream of, such as having my wings worn by Victoria's Secret Angels in the 2014 - 2015 fashion shows Worn by Katy Perry for an H&M holiday video Funds from Patreon will help support the creation of tutorials, tips and tricks related to fairy cosplay, digital design content, as well as more creative fairy photo shoots. It will also support me in the unpaid research and development time needed for new products, such as fairy themed jewelry, enamel pins / charms, digital items, Second Life™ wings and more. I'm now making more elaborate wing art with more work going into each set, designs that I am passionate about. I've discovered I'm more an artist than a large business or production company and I'm happier working this way. Creating innovative designs & new techniques is what motivates me, and I have more ideas and visions for faerie art than I can count. In fact I recently registered over 60 different designs to be incorporated into accessories, yet to be manifested for you. It's not exactly the most profitable business model however, and the last couple years under this new presidential administration has made things tougher for me. I am hoping Patreon might fill in some of those gaps and allow me to create the things I've been dreaming of and still be able to pay rent while I'm creating new designs or techniques. I will not stop creating & selling wings!  But for now I think the community craves more information on DIY projects and connection so I want to give back, and don't want to leave out those who can't afford to purchase product. Though I initially was on the 'per creation' plan where patrons only get charged when I drop content, I've changed it now to per month. It prevents people from being able to swoop in to grab all the content and then bail before even getting charged for their membership, something I didn't realize was even possible when I chose that creator account type in the beginning. I rarely had more than 1 charge per month anyway, and, I also need the support no matter if I'm providing content such as files or tutorials, or if I'm venturing into new projects and needing that boost. Please also note that I can't give refunds to people who paid for a yearly subscription, so make sure that's what you want to do and cancel before it's renewed for the next year. Fair warning, I am openly supportive of progressive and liberal activism and participate in it myself so you may see content concerning human rights issues once in a while here.  *Note - If you're here for a mechanical flapping wing tutorial, that tutorial is available now on the $10 a month Alchemist Tier!

It can be\nchallenging to remain creative, independent and vested, to be the voice of so\nmany animals and people, while worrying about the financing of this journey. \n \nThis is the reason I decided to turn to Patreon and to ask my village to rally around my work.

The more money I make, the more empty carbohydrates I can buy to fuel this tired hand and churn out endless  backstories for gifs . Right now, I am making  2 of these per week , but maybe I can do other stuff too! Maybe if I have enough time on my hands, I can use some of it to work on this  super-cool fantasy comic  that I've wanted to make for over a year now! You can trust me when I say that this story is chock full of whimsy, humor, and all sorts of other stuff that is totally engrossing and fun. Maybe there are sky pirates? Maybe there are ghost pirates? Gnomes? Sure! Bird people? You betcha! If you want this story to come to fruition as much as I do, then this is the place to drop your money. I promise I will make it worth something.  Maybe there will be other things too. Maybe animation someday? Hopefully!

Pridelands was birthed in the mind of Los Angeles-based artist Marco Bernard after imagining Scar, from Disney's the Lion King as a character on the Netflix original series, Beastars. This passing thought evolved into the now familiar anthropomorphic drawing of Scar in a black suit that has circulated the internet, trending on Twitter, and appearing in numerous publications such as Buzzfeed and Popsugar. Naturally, the fans demanded Scar had some company, so the rest of the Pridelands family was born, including Mufasa, Simba and Nala, Sarabi, Shenzi the Hyena, Rafiki, and many others characters that are now familiar parts of internet history, on t-shirts and hoodies, stickers and your imaginations. Pridelands, in spite of a rapid fan response and massive internet footprint, was still only beginning to evolve. Ashlea, a longtime college friend of Marco's and writer, decided the characters deserved a modern story to match their new modern introduction to the 21st century world. Her story was a present-day gritty tale where Mufasa and Scar ran a multi-billion dollar company called, Pride Rock Realty, in California. When Mufasa, without consulting Scar, makes a decision that will forever change  Pride Rock Realty, an innocent story of two self-made brothers becomes of tragedy of death, infidelity, fraud, betrayal and the family will never be the same. Pridelands still, however, had more to give to the fans when animator, Marquise Staton, and character design artist, Jonathan Edwards, breathed life literally into the Pridelands characters through motion. In this new light, the fan base made the request--no, demanded--for more and that's why this page exist. When the fans speak, the creators listen. We are the Pridelands Mastermind Team: Marco, Ashlea, Quise and Johnny. You are entering a world that is new, wild, and filled with twist and turns, but that was designed completely with you in mind. This is your escape, and this is your story.  We read your messages. We saw your tags, posts and reposts, videos, tweets and we are answering you. \"What's next? Where's the rest?\" you asked us over and over and finally we are answering. This story is yours. We have all grown up and are still growing, so our familiar characters are growing with us. You will be in your feelings. You will feel great joy and laugh. You may get frustrated and pissed off (Sorry in advance). You may get upset and cry (Also, sorry about that).  You will also feel like you can't get enough (Not sorry). We need you to build Pridelands with us, step by step, page by page, character by character, we want you to write the story with us. This is yours so feel free to share this page, give and invite your friends and family to give. You build the Pridelands world with your contributions so we thankful to you for giving and we are listening to you.

If you have any questions about Full of Eyes--or what it's like to be a part of the FOE support team--feel free to message me at  [email protected] .  Or,\nyou can read over the more in-depth ministry info below. About Full of Eyes \n\nJesus Christ is God. He is the incarnation of the eternal,\nself-revealing Word of God. He is the living exegesis of the invisible God, the\nname of God spoken in space and time, the glory of God radiated through flesh\nand blood, the Son whom to see is to see the Father and whom to know is to know\nthe only true God. \n\n \n\nAnd—wonder of wonders!—the sovereignly chosen climax of\nJesus’ ministry of God-revealing redemption comes when He pours Himself out in\nlove to the point of death on a Roman cross. Worldviews are baffled, paradigms\nare controverted, and entire universes of philosophical thought are shattered\nand re-forged when we realize that Yahweh God—maker of heaven and\nearth—definitively communicates Himself to creation in the crucified and risen\nman, Jesus Christ.  \n\n \n\nall things exist for the glory of God, and if God is\nsupremely made known in the one who died and rose again, then we align\nourselves with the purpose of reality when we—by the Spirit—look to the cross\nso that we might know and love the Father through His slain and risen Son. \n\n \n\nThis is why Full of Eyes exists.  My goal is to help people see and savor the\nfaith-strengthening, hope-instilling, love-kindling beauty of God in Christ.\nAnd I do this by creating free exegetical art in the form of pictures,\nanimations, and discussion guides.  \n\n Four Specific Emphases \n\n Biblical  – God has authoritatively revealed Himself to us in\nScripture. If we are going to know and love Him, we must meet Him in His Word.\nTherefore, I apply the same rigorous exegetical principles that would go into\npreparing a sermon as I create these art pieces. If my work is to serve the\nChurch, it must be rooted in, saturated with, and communicative of Scripture.  \n\n \n\nChristocentric  – Within Scripture, God’s supreme\nself-revelation is His Son, Jesus Christ—and especially the Son’s work of\nrevelatory redemption at the cross. Therefore the art of Full of Eyes is\nuniquely centered on the person and work of Christ. \n\n \n\nEvangelistic  – Every piece of art that I create is born from\na desire to make the person and work of Christ more weighty, compelling, and\nprecious to the viewer—whether they are saved or not-yet saved. This is what I\nmean by “evangelistic.” \n\n \n\nAffectional  – Jonathan Edwards once said that he considered\nit his duty in preaching to raise the affections of his hearers as high as he\npossibly could—provided they were affected by nothing but truth. This concept\ninforms my art. By God’s grace, I want Full of Eyes to haunt hearts and kindle\naffections with the terrors and beauties of the gospel of the glory of Christ. \n\n Three Main Undertakings \n\n \n\nPictures  – Each weekday I create a simple picture based on a\nshort text of Scripture (usually from my morning reading), while each month I\ndesign two or three more involved exegetical pieces. In creating these monthly\npictures I employ many of the tools used in traditional sermon preparation\n(studies in the original languages, discourse analysis, outlining, considering\nbiblical theological allusions, seeking to discern authorial intent, etc.). It\nis a true joy to see my training from Bethlehem College & Seminary used by\nthe Lord in this way. \n\n \n\nAnimations  – Animations are the central labor of Full of\nEyes and usually take between three and four months of work to complete.\nThey’re often based on a song that highlights some element of the person and\nwork of Christ, though recently I’ve been moving toward  more “exegetical animations” built on\ninstrumental music and spoken Scripture. In either case the motivating desire\nis the same: to communicate something of the all-surpassing and soul-satisfying\nbeauty of God as He is climactically revealed in the crucified and risen Son. \n\n \n\nDiscussion Guides  – Since 2014 I’ve been making discussion\nguides that go along with each animation. These guides are intended to help\nsmall groups or individuals explore the scriptural and theological concepts\nthat fuel a particular animation’s imagery. \n\n"},

My name is Colin. I love to make things. I live to communicate with and connect to all types of people. I am a musician, visual artist, writer, podcast host, seeker, critical thinker, psychedelic advocate, public speaker and a plethora of other things that I have yet to officially become or have the courage to call myself. I do all of these things independently as well as collaboratively and I've been doing them \"full time\" now for well over 15 years.  Thank You For Giving A Damn...  I feel insanely lucky that one or perhaps a few of the things that I do has somehow connected to you and made you want to support me in a more direct, concrete and sustaining way and for that I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH. I plan on putting a lot of thought, care and energy into this and I look forward to building something that makes you even more proud and excited to support me. Why I Need You...  We all need help.   I'm just learning how to ask for it now as it's not something that's ever been easy for me to do. It has become untenable for me to continue pursuing my visions without assistance.  I want to do an art show in a house instead of a gallery. I want to do more remixes, finish my 2nd solo album and multiple musical side project collaborations. I want to write and publish my first book. I want to do workshops on sacred creativity all over the world. I want to finish the multiple screen plays I have half written. I want to host live podcast events for The Cosmic Nod.  And so on... I have so many creative desires but frankly without your help I will be unable to keep any of them my priority.  I have reached a state where I spend all of my time outside of the band, grinding on commissions or promoting, producing and fulfilling my webstore in order to support myself and family. This is a perfectly fine living that I am lucky to have and while I already work far more than I would like, I can't help but feel like I could be doing so much more... I feel like those who have supported me through the years have expressed wanting this from me as well. A Simple Equation...  The more support I receive, the more I can explore, make cooler stuff, support causes that I believe in and even hire people to help me like : an editor for my podcast, someone to help me fulfill my webstore orders so I can keep it open while I'm traveling, rad independent printers, designers for my products and projects, engineers and other musicians & artists for my projects and so on...   The Struggle Is Real...  As I'm sure you can relate, when sweating how to pay bills every month it becomes harder and harder to carve out the time to explore my most interesting ideas, to put the most into the ones I already am juggling and most importantly to do them with integrity and without third party interference... When it comes to my visual art, solo music, writing and podcast; these are self funded ventures of passion that I have no interest in compromising out of desperation via selling percentages and input to corporate entities that I simply don't align with... The reality however is that if I don't have a more stable line support for these things I get put in a position of choosing between compromise, delay or defeat.  It's Time To Step Up...  Having been encouraged by so many of you over the years to start something like this and I have finally decided to give it a try. With multiple successes via  Kickstarter  and  Indiegogo  under my belt I have faith and experience in crowdfunding as something beyond just a stabilizing force but something progressively empowering to artists and their supporters. I myself have actively supported multiple creators on here and it's made me extremely INSPIRED to make my own.  Let's Make Something Magical Together...   Over the years I have noticed an increasingly recognizable and shared spirit amongst those who really resonate with the things I do and I think it's finally time to bring you all together! I will definitely be communicating with you for what it is you'd like to see more or less of on here and see this ultimately as a collaboration to make this a mutually fulfilling as possible. I want this Patreon to serve whatever purpose you came here for but I would also love to create a community of new and old friends here that is centered on a sharing of interests, relationships and questions that tend to inspire us.  I want to talk about art, music, films, books, food, health and all the other things with you and if this grows into the community I'm imagining that it could, I'd love to eventually throw patron only events where we can hang in meat space. You Are My Safe Place...   For years now I have wanted to be more intimate, vulnerable and communicative with the people who support me but lets be real, it's scary out there and between a zillion apps I'm spread thin. The podcast is a big step in that desired direction and while I of course still strive to be open & authentic on all social media platforms, I hold back ALOT ie: doing videos where I talk to the camera, talk candidly about my life, ideas, struggles, etc. and I would feel way more comfortable doing that here. Seems like the type of thing that this platform was built for.  I Can't Thank You Enough For Being Here. (BUT I WILL TRY)   If you are unable to support me on Patreon yourself, you can always suggest it to a friend or even help me promote it, those things mean just as much to me as a pledge. The more sustainable assistance I have, the more signals I can boost, the more causes I can support, the more beauty and truth I can help bring into the world.  THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. Infinite gratitude, light and love Colin"},

It takes all kinds of work on projects most people never know about to make our costumes come to life. Latinvixen's Workshop is a space for sharing information and an opportunity for you to take a deeper dive into how we do the things we do. In this Patreon I'll focus on 3d design, art, fursuit design and construction, tutorials, and a peek behind the scenes of the operations at MixedCandy. We'll cover topics like mold making, software reviews and demos, 3D printers and how to use them, basics of sculpting in Z-Brush, airbrushing, the types of materials we use and how they work, and much more. In addition to sharing information and behind the scenes sneak peeks, there are even more perks to signing up to one of the Workshop tiers. I'll be live-streaming question and answer sessions once a month exclusively to the top tier group. I'll post opportunities to purchase designs  only  available here through Patreon (things like foam casts, character designs, custom commissioned art, and more!). We'll have giveaways, private auctions, the chance to interact and vote on upcoming designs, and lots of goodies that you won't find anywhere else.

I’m not sure if I’m an illustrator first and a GM second or if it’s the other way around, but my maps, tokens and assets are hand-drawn and informed by decades of running and playing TTRPGs. FAQ What program do you use to make your maps? My early maps (prior to 2021) were drawn with ProCreate for iPad. Since then I’ve created maps and tokens with Clip Studio Paint using a Wacom Cintiq tablet. Do you take commissions? Yes, sometimes! This Patreon serves as one of a couple sources of revenue to help fill in the gaps between commissions. Sometimes I’ve got a pretty full plate working on larger commercial projects and am unable to take on any extra, but feel free to reach out here or via any of my social media pages for any inquiries about my rates and availability. Can I use your maps for my stream? Definitely. Just please provide credit and a link to my Patreon. For other uses of my maps, I have a  commercial license  available to patrons at the CR 8 tier. Do you offer maps pre-configured for specific VTTs (virtual tabletops)? Yes! I offer Foundry VTT modules with integrated walls, lighting and animations to CR 8 patrons. I also sell dynamic lighting map packs on the  Roll20 Marketplace . How does pay per creation work on Patreon? Do I have to pay for every map? Pay per creation allows you to pay for one or more monthly releases, at your own discretion. It’s my hope that this model keeps my content accessible for those without the means to finance every creation."},

This initiative will also allow the exploration of brand new talent with fresh innovative vision. What would a top Magic: The Gathering or LucasFilm artist come up with if they were let loose on BattleTech? A Marvel Studios concept artist? Will we discover BattleTech's Ralph McQuarrie with a project like this? My goal is to recruit every fan of the BattleTech and MechWarrior franchises eager to see new content and fresh perspectives to contribute just $2 a month to the fund. Imagine what kind of work this initiative could help generate if 500, 1000 fans came together to make even that basic contribution! Of course, if individuals would like to give more, they can do so when registering their pledge.

Paradoxical and yet perfectly in keeping with the complexities of her brain, this Cali-Brit girl can’t help but want to share her raw humorous tales with you. With a penchant for adventure, and a witty banter over a cup of Rose Green Tea. What more would you ask from a single Brit living in California who has chosen to not have sex until marriage in the era of LBGTQ+, hookups, Hinge, and a pandemic? What you’ll find here are the raw tales. The behind the scenes stories of life, love, laughter, and a lassez-faire approach to ungentlemanly behavior. As a woman who is obsessed with character and freedom - she hopes to be a kind friend, someone you can approach with any question. May this be a new platform in which she gets to stretch her wings, and tell you more tales without restriction.  Her opinions are her own, and are by no means a reflection on anyone she is associated with, this is said with intention, as she aims to not just talk to the church anymore, but the world at large.   Names, locations and vocations have been changed, and (most) stories will have been approved by the characters themselves. Unless they weren’t nice people. In which case, that’s the beauty of changing the names, and the beauty of requiring a subscription. All are forgiven, all bring a smile to the face. The majority of the deprecation will be towards myself.  I am British after all. "},

Small pledges make a big difference. But what's extra cool and unique about Patreon is that by becoming a patron at any level you get cool rewards, a well as the rewarding knowledge that you’re genuinely helping a creator create the creations you love.  For just $5 a month, you'll get to see six new cartoons every week, plus other content shared exclusively here. These rewards will likely evolve overtime, as I learn what things my fans value more. Either way, thank you so much if you've even read this far down.  So climb aboard the Turtleship, and welcome to Nehemia! Enjoy my cartoons :) 🦋🦕"},

Main Street, Durham, N.C. </big> Founded in 2008 by Kym Register, the creative voice behind the country music group Loamlands, The Pinhook is an anchor of Durham’s thriving music scene. It’s a local haunt of many of the indie musicians who have recently put The Bull City on the music map – Sylvan Esso and Phil Cook – and it’s a celebrated haven and presenter for the LGBTQ community in the Triangle. J. Clapp, who performs as the popular drag diva  Vivica C. Coxx , says the best thing about The Pinhook’s programming is that you never know what you’re going to get but “It’s always open and affirming of people with marginalized backgrounds, and it’s always giving of its time and energy in ways that most clubs and venues aren’t. It’s very Durham, and it’s very who I want to be.”  The ethos of the club – to pay artists a living wage, and to create a safe space for marginalized communities – permeates the programming and the community that has come to know and love The Pinhook. In celebration of Pride Month, we step inside The Pinhook for June’s Listen Local, our  video series profiling unique venues and places where music is made, performed and celebrated in North Carolina.

I am a Dutch artist, illustrator, art teacher and writer. My mission is to encourage people to draw without being precious about each drawing. I believe - and I know for a fact - that everything is interesting when you draw it. When you draw, you start to look, and when you look, you start to really  see . You may know me from my weekly YouTube series Draw Tip Tuesday, where I offer free tips on drawing techniques, and advice about developing a creative habit. I’ve been doing this since 2013. On Instagram, I set an example on how drawing can be fun, exciting, adventurous and also a form of meditation.   If you support me here on Patreon, I can keep creating Draw Tip Tuesday videos on YouTube consistently. A little bit of background: I live in Amsterdam (where I was born and raised), and part time in Rotterdam - I am so lucky because these are my two most favorite cities in the Netherlands. As a creative entrepreneur, I worked as an award-winning professional photographer for 10 years after which I gradually focused on drawing and painting. As I developed as an artist, I strongly felt the need to share my experience and learnings with others. By developing and teaching art classes and workshops online and offline, I wholeheartedly teach people why drawing, painting and creativity makes them happy, and how it can change the way they see the world - and themselves. Perhaps you know that I co-founded Sketchbook Skool in 2014 together with Danny Gregory; an online art school designed to inspire creative storytelling through illustrated journaling.  In June 2020 I left Sketchbook Skool's management, because it was time for new adventures, but I am still involved with the community. After taking a sabbatical, which stretched out a little longer than anticipated thanks to the pandemic, I am now so excited to start creating and sharing here on Patreon. I feel honored that you are here and considering backing me on Patreon. Thank you! I want to help you grow as an artist, by sharing all the things I have learned and am learning (because as an artist, you never stop learning). All tiers are designed to encourage you and give you guidance, no matter your skill level. If you'd like to support me, that's awesome. Please choose the monthly pledge that best suits you.

That's so great. Thank you! My name is J.J. You may know me as the guy who makes the X-Files episode posters. Or maybe you know my work creating Star Trek prints and comic covers. Or you could know me from my vintage-style Star Wars posters. However you discovered my work, first off I want to say THANK YOU for any likes, shares, reblogs, retweets, comic and print purchases, or thoughtful messages you may have sent my way. It has literally changed my life. So with that in mind, let me tell you a little bit more about my life beyond what you've seen in my artwork. ABOUT ME I've been making art for as long as I can remember. When I was a kid growing up in Pittsburgh, adults would ask me \"What do you want to be when you grow up?\" I would always say without hesitation - \"An artist\". It was a foregone conclusion. But as I got older, the adults around me would continue to acknowledge the talent I had for drawing and making art BUT they would also discourage me from pursuing art as a career. They'd tell me art was an unstable and risky field and that I should do something else for a living for better peace of mind. In the end, it seemed like good advice. So when I became the first member of my family to go to college, I decided not to study art. When I graduated (just as the recession hit the U.S.) there was no career waiting for me. However, I did have all sort of jobs. I taught pre-school at a daycare center. I toured with a theater company as an actor performing plays for kids about bullying. I worked with inner-city teenagers as a library assistant. I lived paycheck to paycheck. Some days I would scan the sidewalks for change on my way to the bus stop in hopes to have enough money to afford the bus ride to work that morning. I didn't feel particularly stable or safe and I wasn't making art for a living. And as much as I enjoyed some aspects of the work I was doing with youth and helping communities, I still felt this pull to make art, to pursue the life I always thought I was destined for when I was a kid. Then on a whim one October, I decided to start a blog and take part in Inktober - a challenge where artists make one piece of art a day for an entire month and share it online. I'm a lover of film and television and decided to take the challenge a step further and create a full one-sheet poster everyday for episodes of one of my favorite shows - The X-Files. It was tough - working full-time and trying to create a piece of art each day. I'd usually have to do it on my lunch break at work or while I should have been sleeping at night. But after doing it for a few weeks (to my great surprise) people started noticing my work online and motivated me to keep going. So I did. And as I worked to make more art, it became clearer to me that if I was constantly stressed about making ends meet anyway, why was I not at least trying to make a living doing the thing that I loved? So slowly but surely while I was still working full-time at my day job, I built a portfolio, I started a website, I kept working and I kept going. I found fans. I found clients. I began playing in sandboxes I would never have dreamed of - making art for some of my favorite TV shows and films. And over time, I've been fortunate enough to slowly transition to a life where I can focus on my art in a more full-time capacity. But those adults that discouraged me from life as a professional artist were right about one thing: this isn't the most stable profession, especially for a freelancer like me. Hence: Patreon! HOW PATREON WORKS I'm starting this page as a way for fans of my work to contribute to what I do beyond purchasing art or commissioning work (but please feel free to do that as well!). For as little as $1.00 a month, you can help support what I do and ensure my studio both survives and thrives. But wait... there's more! If you're able to pledge in a higher tier, you'll begin to unlock access to behind-the-scenes content. Find out how I create my artwork, see early drafts and discarded concept art, and preview works that are yet to come. I also hope to add even more features for patrons down the line so stay tuned... and THANK YOU! Find my work here: WEBSITE TWITTER INSTAGRAM FACEBOOK TUMBLR SHOP"},

Hello! I am Kajin(man). I was drawing since I can remember and I love to make fan art of characters of video games, animation, manga, movies and everything that I consider interesting in my spare time. I like doing action scenes, pin ups and snfw stuff. What you'll find here? I draw mostly girls, fan art from games, anime, movies and other interesting things. I will do pinups, soft and nsfw (All Characters portrayed are 18+). Here I only post the standard versions, I send the other versions in a private message when the corresponding month's pack is ready (The higher patrons will have the opportunity to receive HD images and PSD files).  My patreon charges in advance so if you are my Patron during a specific month (for example January), then you will receive the corresponding pack of that month during the first days of the next month (in the case of this example it would be in the first days of February). Tier 1 does not receive any pack of images, the main benefit of this Tier is to be able to participate in polls and posts where I ask for character suggestions (these are benefits that all Tier has). Tier 2 receives the images pack of the month subscribed, in web resolution (about 566x800 px). Tier 3 and Tier 3.5 receive the images pack of the month subscribed, in high resolution (about 2828x4000 px). Tier 4 receives the images pack and PSD pack of the month subscribed, in high resolution (about 2828x4000 px) and is the only Tier that receives an additional pack from a previous month of their choice. (I delete links after 2 or 3 weeks of sending them, so please be sure to check.) Beside from Tier 4 the only way to get the packs from previous months is through my Gumroad. https://gumroad.com/kajin I hope this makes clear the benefits of each Tier. If you are new here and you are interested in some of my previous work you can get it through my $15 Tier or through my Gumroad:  gumroad.com/kajin What is my goal?  I just want to cover my personal expenses while practicing as much as possible (I also want to try new things, like animations or comics) and share my work with you.  So the more help I get more time I can spend with my Patreon and I can make more and better content. Any help will be appreciated and I will do my best for you to be happy."},

I am a queer person (he/him/they/them/name) and make game stuff. I am a game artist and illustrator, and also write games. I have been in a bunch of tabletop role-playing gamebooks (usually really detailed black and white illustrations). Some of the things that I have made myself and published were some art zines, the game  Runaway Hirelings , and  A Greeblins Journey , Escape of the Free Magus, What's so cool about mecha battles? and some other small games and experiences. I also make commercial use stock art. I also like to make paper miniatures for role-playing games and wargaming. What do you get? Each month you get access to the big commercial stock art pond which is a folder of all of my stock art, fonts, resources, texture packs, photo packs, etc. You get to hear about my games as I work on them, the $5 tier gets my finished self-published games as they come out. $3 Patrons get to see the secret playtests and drafts of things as they are being developed. I will also be putting out non-game digital stuff, so like paper miniatures, battle maps, or other stuff (like photoshop brush packs). The things that aren't my big full games everyone gets as a Patron. I sell this stuff individually otherwise on itch.io for anywhere from $6 to $10 for each thing. So at the highest Patron tier you are going to save often $5.00. If you want to preview the terms for the Commercial Use license before signing up,  the terms are viewable here to everyone . What comes in the future? Over time as make more stuff I am hoping that I can support making more stuff. I want to color in those paper miniatures, make more of them. Up my game design game and how I present my work. But that is for me, the next thing is for you. What you get each month and what will come in the future are new games, more art to use for playing games, making your own game stuff. That pond of art will grow to become a large ocean if I have my way. When I make more games, more games get posted here. Games like the finished version of A Greeblins Journey, my roll and write ALIENS inspired solo game, my game about Redwall type critters in the forest adventuring. I have a folder of half finished and barely started projects and games and there are forty folders in there. I want to finish what I have started and this patreon, and your patronage will make that happen. It will make weird and different things something that I can spend more time doing. It will mean I can make games that are special to me, that are full of my heart, and that will be lovingly made by me. Let me make more stuff like  this (things I have previously released) . And  let me draw more stuff that is different, that is like I have done before  and  experiment with what I want to do in the future . Not being a Patron won't stop me from making and exploring, but with your help I can do it faster."},

I am Aalma and I am constantly challenging myself to learn new things and improve. Currently, hosting the  \"IN2D Animation\" Challenge  which helps beginners like me to step into 2D animation. I will be happy to have you on board, learn and improve along.   \"IN2D Animation\" Challenge    is a 6-months long challenge for beginners that will help us learn and practice animation from scratch. We will focus on the  basics of animation , will understand  keys and timing , will practice  volume consistency , and will dive into the  principles of animation . Every two weeks I will provide a list of  assignments  with resources, examples, and practical exercises to do in order to understand the topics better. I will accomplish the assignments myself and I will share my approach and the steps I have followed. You’ll get a special look  behind the scenes  as I learn and create animations, illustrations, and other art-related content on the way. The  \"bliss\"  tier supportive Souls will also benefit from monthly  personal feedback sessions!    PATREON CONTENT EXCEPTIONS   Only the  \"bliss\" tier  will have full access to the entire Patreon content posted before including  \" A Topic A Week Challenge \"  and  \" 7 Months of Improvement Challenge \" . The  \"smile\"  and the  \"joy\"  tiers will have access to the previous and upcoming \"IN2D Animation\" challenge content only. You can still find the previous challenges on my  Gumroad Shop . *I provide  monthly DISCOUNT CODES for all my shops  so as a Supportive Patron, you'll be able to grab them at a lower price Q: WHAT KIND OF ANIMATION WE WILL LEARN A: We will focus on frame-by-frame 2D animation. We will learn it from the very basics to the principles of animation Q: WHICH SOFTWARE YOU'LL USE? A: We will not focus on learning specific software. We will learn the principles of animation so you can animate in whatever software you desire, even on paper. Though, I will accomplish the challenge in Photoshop and TVPaint animation. I will also try Procreate and other software and I will share with you what I have learned along the way. Q: HOW THE CHALLENGE WORKS? A: The challenge is based on once in two weeks assignments. Along with the participants I accomplish the assignment list myself and during these weeks I provide you with the process that includes HD images, show-how videos, real-time/time-lapse video processes, PSD files, and brushes I used so you can take and maybe learn from them. Q: CAN I JOIN THE CHALLENGE EVEN IF I MISS THE START DATE? A: Sure thing you can! All the content will stay on Patreon as long as the challenge will be ongoing. You can join and catch up with the assignments whenever you desire. We also have an open Discord community where you can find new friends, art-related challenges and events, ask questions, receive feedback, and more. Come  JOIN  and enjoy us!    Thank You!    I'll be enormously happy to have you on this journey 🤗💜"},

Welcome to my Patreon  2020 - New year/ New Decade/ New Ways/ New Platform I’m doing a Patreon, because I make so much stuff and record so many things that aren’t music and don’t fit on other platforms. I'm still making music, putting out the 6th album which is nearly finished, on a normal label, same as the others.  but on here - I don't want to limit my creative energy output, and keep it open. It started because of the documentary, \"MATANGI / MAYA / M.I.A\" - which was just a tiny, teeny bit of what's on my harddrives, and when we put that out, everyone kept asking to see the whole tapes, more about this bit or that bit and I was trying to find a good place for it. I don't even know where this journey is going to take everyone... I know I'm going to travel a lot this year, and take a camera with me - so when I'm in these places that I end up, learning all this new stuff, I want to share it, and I'm just going to post whatever I'm doing, what I'm learning, who I'm meeting and what connections come my way. I'm making films, music, making art and I'll be posting that process on here. But I want to make it fun and random, it might be ASMR Sri Lankan cooking, or I might go and stay in a silent Ashram in India for a month and just not speak, or I want to interview interesting people, do some reporting, make clothes, make paintings, just see where it takes me.  And I want to connect with people. I'll be livestreaming and sharing and learning from people on here, hopefully.  Maybe I can help some people on here? You can ask me for help with your music or art portfolio, or relationships advice, or show me your work and I can try to help you  - and I can ask you questions, can I get some free therapy? Maybe you guys get to be my manager for a month and I follow your advice? Anyway, I like the idea of Patreon because it's really simple and it's about bringing things back to artists making art.  If we can get enough Patrons happening I would love to take that help and money and do a project somewhere in the world that we can post updates from and follow progress and use collective knowledge and skills to really do something good. I'm starting 31st Jan 2020. Join me on here, let's see what happens  PEace xx"},

[Only official IP characters will be taken for suggestion, no OCs.] Both the colored sketch sequences and colored sketches  will be decided from the  first, second, third, fourth and fifth place winners  from the  monthly character polls , with an initial character poll and a runoff poll to finalize the winner positions. With  the first, second and third place winners becoming colored sketch sequences  and  fourth and fifth place becoming colored sketches . In addition to that the top tier patrons will also receive one black and white  single character  sketch commission each month!  See commission info  here. So what kind of art will I post here?

Page:  https://www.erikalancaster.com/patreon-faq.html 👉  Free Patreon Class/Tutorial Samples + List of Available Classes:  https://www.erikalancaster.com/patreon_samples.html If this is our first time meeting,  hello ! 👋 I’m a traditional media artist and online teacher that's  obsessed  with creating art and helping others make progress in their own art journeys.  I 100% believe the world would be a better place with more art and artists in it, and this is why I'm passionate about sharing  everything  I know, no holds barred, and inspiring others to stay consistent with their art practice.  I spend my days creating art using a variety of traditional mediums, producing helpful content that I share via  my website  and my  YouTube channel , and mentoring beginner/intermediate artists from all over the world so they can gain the necessary technical and mindset skills to finally see their visions come to life. Before starting in the online space, I worked as a Graphic Designer/Art Director at an advertising agency and as head Art Teacher in a school for many years. I began teaching art out of my own home studio in those last few years of still working my \"regular\" job and after some time, decided to take my art business full-time.  By this point, I was teaching students of all ages and many different mediums, as I continued developing my own art skills and selling my own work locally. Seeing the positive impact that art creation and artistic development were having on the lives of my students inspired me to take what I was doing to the online space.  I’m here to provide no-nonsense guidance to aspiring artists who're serious about taking their skills to a new level and want to bring their own light to the world. Though I  love  sharing helpful blog posts and YouTube videos, it's impossible for me to provide the type of in-depth, consistent guidance and individualized feedback  that can be provided via a closed membership site like this one.  I'm also a  huge  believer in making quality art education accessible for people and am excited to share what I've learned in art school, as well as my many years making a living in the art/design field.  Most art teachers and courses out there teach only  techniques  and set aside the Art Fundamentals that are going to give you the knowledge and tools required to be able to create original, impactful visual compositions from scratch that are balanced, harmonious, and transmit your personal message to the world. You end up creating carbon copies of what the instructor is doing, which is perfectly fine if you're creating art for fun.  But you'll notice that, in my instruction, I take it way further.  In my posts and tutorials (and of course- the classes available for the Rising Star tier and upwards), I share tons of information on Art Fundamentals/art school basics that are going to help you start asking the right questions throughout the creative process (before, during and after), and practical advice that'll help you get into the flow of creating your own original work from scratch.  All for a fraction of the cost of online courses and without the huge debt that going to art school brings! 🎉🎉 👉  What you can look forward to as a member: There are four different tiers that you can join depending on your needs and each gets access to different benefits including: ⭐ 2 new Patreon-exclusive real-time/step-by-step tutorials  every-single-month  *These tutorials are minimally edited (not sped up), include a voiceover explanation all throughout the video, and have downloadable attachments (outline sketch, reference photo, etc.) ⭐ Direct feedback from me on any artwork you'd like to share  *EXCLUSIVE FOR $15 AND UPWARDS*  (I’m checking on posts in the Community tab as well as on messages and emails from Monday through Friday) ⭐ Sketchbook prompts sent to your inbox every Monday designed to keep you consistent and progressing your skills/knowledge on important art topics ⭐ Private art livestreams every month where we work in our sketchbooks together and I answer any questions you have ⭐ Classes and workshops on Art Fundamentals (art school basics!), as well as art assignments that will help reinforce the knowledge you've gained in each lesson  * These classes are uploaded onto the Art Fundamentals Class Library and are designed to be seen in chronological order, taking you from simple topics to more complex topics (Elements and Principles of Art, Composition, Perspective, Drawing Faces, Light Behavior, and much more) ⭐ Access to a growing vault of original art reference photos taken by myself that gets 5 new photos added each month ⭐ As a member, you have access to the  entire  back catalog of posts for the tier you choose to join, for as long as this Patreon site exists (which I anticipate being a  very  long time!) ⭐ Participation in polls for topics for new content being created Here’s some information that will help you navigate the  Becoming Artists  membership site: \n\n *Important note: The site’s layout and interface changes depending on what device you’re visiting it with. I highly encourage you to use this site on a desktop or laptop, as it's not only easier, but you'll be able to see the videos I share on a larger screen. 👉  How you get charged \n When you join you get charged right away for the current month, as you immediately get access to the entire back catalog of any tier you choose to join. After that, you get charged on the same day that you joined, in the following month.  You can upgrade/downgrade your tier or stop pledging at  any  time. There are no binding contracts keeping you for any specific amount of time, which is one of the beauties of Patreon! On a cell phone (Patreon app):  Click the 3 dots in the top right of the screen. You can edit your pledge amount. Under “Your Tier” click “Edit” and you will see the different membership levels. Click “Select” on your new level. Scroll down and click “Update” to finalize. On Desktop:  Hover over your avatar (cute little icon) on the upper right corner. Scroll down to “Manage Memberships”.  👉 The site has four main sections/tabs: 1.  Home-  Here you’ll be able to find all of the posts I've shared (Sketchbook Challenges, tutorials, livestream recordings and more) all in chronological order. You can search for specific posts past posts by using the Search field in the top right, searching by media type, date, tier, or by using tags.  *Tags are words that I add into each of the posts I share that help organize them into different searchable \"categories\". By going to the Posts section of the site, you'll see all of the most popular tags in the upper section, including \"Watercolor Tutorial\", \"Sketchbook Challenges\", etc. You can click on any of these, or click on the \"48 more...\" to the right of them. A drop-down menu will appear, showing all of the different tags I add into posts and you can click on whichever interests you. 2.  Community-  This is a special area for members to post their work, comments, and where we’ll be able to interact with each other. I’ll be checking on this tab from Monday through Friday, providing feedback and engaging with you. It's incredibly important for me to create a positive community where we all feel safe and comfortable sharing and providing each other feedback. 3. About-  This section you're in now, where I explain who I am and more about how I've set up my Patreon page. 4.  Membership-  Welcome notes I send after members join, as well as what I offer in my different tiers.  \n\n Thank you  so  much for popping by!  It truly means the world and I’m very excited to help you move forward in your artistic journey.💙 Here are a few comments from some of my one-on-one students and online community members:  \" I have followed Erika for a while on her blog, Pinterest, watched her videos, and receive her newsletter, enjoying her clear description of art concepts. Now I’ve been lucky enough to join her Facebook art group, watch her weekly live streams and had a personal Skype class. She is approachable, fun, and KIND! She quickly figured out where I was in my creative journey, encouraged me, and gave great feedback and tips to help me move forward.\"  -Barb Maki (Alberta, Canada) \" Erika has helped me improve both my drawing and watercolor skills after I have taught for several years myself. I have taken Erika’s online courses and watched her YouTube instructions and left with plenty of useful information and inspiration. She takes you through step-by-step lessons that are easy to understand and makes important information accessible for aspiring artists at any level. I've found her explanations easier to understand than many textbooks and even classroom instructions I have taken in the past.  I highly recommend Erika’s videos and online classes.\" - Marilyn Weimer (Missouri, USA) \" My favorite thing about my watercolor classes with Erika is that they feel so custom to my level and what I'm interested in. I can tell that she puts a lot of preparation and care into what we cover in  each session. My lessons consist of theoretic introductions where she explains and recommends tools and supplies, and are followed step-by-step demonstrations/tutorials. I have so much fun following along and love how my paintings turn out! Erika is a talented, encouraging and enthusiastic teacher. I would highly recommend booking a class with her if you’re looking to develop your painting skills.\" -Jacqueline Bürgi   (Zurich, Switzerland) \"Erika is energetic, talented, and the love she has towards the art, as well as for art enthusiasts shows in all she does. I truly admire and respect her work, as well as her work ethic. I appreciate the time she has dedicated to inform and teach me different artistic skills. I would love to be able to take more classes with her and be able to work with her in the future.\" -Jesus Cruz (Florida, USA) \" Last week I completed a Skype session with Erika. We had a brilliant class which I thoroughly enjoyed and learned so much from. Erika was well prepared for the lesson and shared her screen to clearly demonstrate the concepts. I learned so much that I will now work on and develop with further practice. I am keen and excited to practice further and develop the concepts she has taught me. Erika is clear and enthusiastic in explaining the topics. I understood each point before we progressed to the next step. After completion of the lesson, Erika also sent me exercises and tips for me to practice. I would highly recommend Erika for art lessons! \" -Jane Maloney (Northampton, UK)"},

Almost two years later, we've become a community of eight hundred ish people and counting, on every continent but Antarctica (so far), we've put out hundreds hours of content, including conversations with poets, artists, psychonauts, healers, & other extraordinary beings, and we've co-created beautiful multimedia zines curated by artists in our community, as well as dynamic evolving conversations around matters of interest to us.  We are musicians, visual artists, poets, grandparents, high school students, professionals, searchers, & freaks.  What unites us seems to be a fascination with the currents of truth and power that run through our deepest experiences of art and love, a sense of humor, and a trust in poetry.   Our 2021-2022 incarnation, SNAKE OIL, has met most every Saturday beginning January 16, 2021.  We've read and write poetry, practiced meditation, performed & set accountability practices, shared artworks & projects-in-progress with one another, taken turns leading & skillsharing, creating new forms of media, excavating the roots of our knowledge systems, & moulting & alchemizing the very substance of our lives. Snake Oil sessions are complimentary to participate in live, and replays and extras are available to supporters on Patreon.

My intention is for this to be a place for my art, tutorials, stories\nand all the things that make my brain (and hopefully yours) feel good.\n \n \n Why Patreon? \n Patreon helps artists, musicians, all creators focus on what they do \nbest. It will help me to focus on this. The artist can then give back to\n you, the Patron, the gifts that most inspire them and are unique to \ntheir world. The truly inspiring work. With your help this Patreon will give me the opportunity and time to be able to focus more of\nmy energies on my own vision and giving back to you. With your help I can fully explore my own directions.\n \n                \n What I am making for you, The Patrons \nI want to publish a hardcover art book of my finished paintings and drawings.\nYour support will help me do this and you will get first rights to any \"specials\" I\nwill offer with it. Many of my pieces have stories wrapped around them, I want\nto be able to write and illustrate those stories and share them you, here,\nfirst. I’ll also quietly and discreetly preview some of my gallery work here. \n \n \nI’ll write about my work (both process and story) and bring you into this world\nwith me. In 2010 I wrote a YA (young adult) book titled The Witches Kitchen and\nit was published through Little Brown Publishing. I want to jump back into that\nworld and explore my other directions. For instance, I am beginning to incorporate\nsculptural designs into my 2D paintings. There are so many avenues to explore and\nI would welcome you to come along with me… into my \"craziness\" as\nVicki often calls it.\n \n \nTake a look around, see what you think... join us if you like …I think we can\nhelp each other. You are welcome here.\n \n \nAllen and Vicki Williams\n \n \n REMEMBER! This page is a Work in Progress so bear with us! :) \n \n Public Posts \nWe will have posts available to the public. These will include my blog posts on things like how I get ideas and inspiration.\n \n \n Rewards \n You will notice there are only 3 Tiers of our Rewards so far... We may be adding more at a later date... But for right now we want to keep this affordable for everyone and our focus is on the Goals we have set. Remember, this is a Work in Progress too. \n Goals \nWe have pretty lofty Goals. WE DO! I want to be able to share my art with you guys.\n \n \n How Patreon Works \nYou can limit what you want to give... or you can give what you want. You can see a breakdown of exactly what you will be getting for your contribution. If you have \nquestions about Patreon in general, questions about billing, payments, \nsoftware, what this all is, etc. please also visit the official \n Patreon Help Center here \n"},

Would you like to support these artists? \n \nNormally, commissioning a piece of artwork suitable for a desktop background or a framed print would cost you hundreds of dollars. But this Patreon will allow you do do a similar thing for only a few bucks. \n\nAll of the proceeds from this page will go toward the production of fantasy artwork via private commissions. The style and subject matter will be traditional high fantasy. For a preview of this style, see  some of the art  commissioned for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game by FFG. (Note: This Patreon is not officially affiliated with FFG or the Lord of the Rings IP). Most of the artists chosen will be selected from the pool of artists that worked on this game. \n \n You will only get charged per commission, and not per month. So you will be getting a reward every time you pay. \n \nHere's what you get: \n $1/commission : Thanks for helping us out! You will get notified when a new piece has been commissioned and you will be sent a public link to view it or download it in standard resolution. \n $3/commission : The lowest tier with full-resolution access. For each commission made after you subscribe, you will be given a link to download the piece in original quality, which you are then free to use (privately) however you like. \n $5/commission : You get access to the full-resolution images as above, but you will also get to participate in polls about which artists to pick. \n $10/commission : In addition to the benefits of the $5 tier, you will also get to participate in polls about what subject matter gets chosen. \n \nFor higher tiers, check out the tiers list. Original Pieces In the case of a physical painting, the artist may be interested in selling the original. If you really love a piece and would like to purchase the original, I will be happy to arrange it, but would like to do it in a fair way. If multiple people would like to purchase the same piece, preference will be given toward those who have not purchased an original before. If there is still a tie, then preference will be given to the higher tier subscriber. If there is still a tie, then preference will be assigned randomly. Commission Frequency I commission approximately 1-2 pieces per month. When you subscribe, there's an option to set yourself up so that no matter how often commissions get made, you'll only be charged a max of 1/month (although this might mean you would not get access to the second commission in a given month when that happens)."},

Ding Dong!  The Wicked Witch is dead!\"   For artists, the old way of doing things is over.  No more big corporate record labels breathing down their necks.  No more contractual obligations tying their hands.  No more money grubbing middle men fleecing them of their just rewards.  However, along with the positive advantages of this new paradigm come certain challenges.  It is now down to the artist to raise financial support in order that he or she can survive and continue to create the work.  Patreon is the way of now and the future.  It is also a wonderful way for an artists' loyal supporters to be actively involved in the production of the art.   Having used other 'crowd sourcing' platforms such as Kickstarter with a great deal of success, I have now decided to fully embrace this new revolutionary model with a view to making it my main creative hub.  I love the idea of being able to create some art, a new song recording say, and then make it instantly available.  To that end I want to set this up as a pay for 'Per Work' rather than the monthly option as I believe that this is the fairest way of going about it and is also a set up that will be best suited to my way of making art.  Patreon has a MONTHLY CAP, so for example, if you want the security of only EVER paying $5 a month maximum, because you don't want to think about it, and that's what your budget can afford, you can cap at $5.  That way it's like paying $5 a month, WITH the added advantage that if I do not post anything in a given month, you will be charged NOTHING.  And if I am really in the zone and being super prolific, you still only pay $5.  This way it's technically better for you and I won't feel like I'm taking advantage.  That's the last thing I want to do!   I have a lot of ideas to make the whole process interesting.  Including 'the story behind the song'.  Either as a written piece or a little film.  There will be photos and films documenting the work process.  Videos.  Also, the occasional live interactive webcast + 'fly on the wall', 'watch me make theatre' etc. webcasts (for $10 & up patrons) and for top tier patrons ( $100 / $1000 ) personalized, one-off surprise rewards such original art work, personal phone calls, postcards, little surrealist gifts etc.  I will also occasionally perform requested covers via Skype.  I will also be releasing extensive archive material (studio demos, 'bedroom demos', out-takes, remixes, rehearsal sessions etc.) either as free downloads or as part of limited edition CD's. Aside from these very limited special releases (which will sometimes include new material) which will be given away FREE to patrons, it is unlikely that I will be releasing actual physical CD's or vinyl any more as I see this platform as being more immediate, affordable and exciting. It's all a big experiment but it feels so right!  Let's take a leap together!  Not a leap in the dark but a leap in the light!   (Special thanks to my dear friend, Amanda Palmer for inspiration and template!)"},

I'm very grateful you joined me here on Patreon. I've created this as a way to bring my music, art and bhakti practice to the world. You may already know me and that I've been immersed in sacred music and bhakti yoga since I was born (except for a short adventure during my teenage years - we don't need to talk about that 😳 ). Over the last 10 years I've been traveling and sharing my music (and what I know about Krishna) around the world. Every continent except Antarctica! Life is shifting. I'm not traveling much, and being home with my family has been a great and welcome gift.  It's also allowing me to something I've been craving - to head into my home studio to create new music and release songs that have been crying to see the light. I can't wait to share them with you first. I'll be creating new music, releasing live recordings, classes on music and bhakti, and behind the scenes glimpses. But, I cannot do this alone. I need my friends to join me on this spirit journey - to be a part of my service. You can help me continue to share sacred music, art, Bhakti and Krishna. Any contribution you can make would be extremely helpful and very appreciated. Together we can grow and expand our message of love and service. From the deepest part of my heart, I welcome you to Patreon and look forward to sharing this journey together and, through our cooperation, with others around the world.

After a long thought process consulting family, friends. and my supporters I decided to resign from my very well-paid, safe, and good job to dedicate all my time and energy to make this small blue dot in the universe we live in, a better place for nature and us. It's a choice that goes with a financial sacrifice I am happy to pay for to support a greater good and appreciate if you decide that my articles, videos, analytics, predictions, newsletter, Twitter posts, and whatever else I will deliver is of that much value for you that it deserves your participation as a Patreon. Why is that of value to you? You will find four different Tiers you can subscribe to and each has incremental content for you joining me as a partner in my daily market search, analytics, and conclusions.  I am located in Germany and an Engineer, Consultant, and Manager with experience of 25 years in Supply Chain Management, Software, and Process improvements in many industries including High Tech, Automotive, and Retail. Throughout my career that brought me into MD positions I have met and learned from Mid- and Top Managers of most blue-chip companies in Germany and many international within transformational phases.  Since mid of 2018, I publish articles at Cleantechnica (in English) and Elektroauto-news (in German) at the start on an average of about one per month. Moving forward I aim to get two articles finished with the same high-quality content and you will be able to read them with  early access  about up to one week before they are published to the broader audience. You will find all my already published articles from the past to review and share on the Patreon page. Timeline : Whenever ready The  newsletter  will be a summary of key findings of the past week(s) with a special focus on Germany and Europe to give a better and more comprehensive understanding how the market develops. Its content, too long to be expressed on Twitter but much shorter and more actual than my articles. I will do that newsletter whenever newsworthy information does appear and not like before every week. Timeline : Weekends Tier 3 includes an  investment letter  that does not give financial advice if you should buy or sell stock but fundamental and technical analytics that aim to help you making good and educated decisions considering the individual situation you are in. Since 30 years I am a successful investor in the StockMarket and have over time learned a lot of lessons that help me to evaluate, assess and decide better. I did invest in Tesla the first time in 2015 having bought my first shares at $167 ($33 post-split) and my last at the recent dip at $192. This section is particularly interesting for long-term investors. Timeline : Last or early days of a month The  Gold Founder Tier  is for all who want to contribute extra to make my work sustainable for the long run. Some Patrons went also above that level who wanted to contribute. My writing, blogging, and YouTubing continue to be a money-losing proposition, but I continue to work to cover my monthly costs and am grateful for every patron who joins me and continues to support me. Every patron, even if it's just a dollar a month, means a lot to me as I get one dollar closer to my goal, but the bigger donors are of course the ones who contribute the most to make my mission possible. Twitter : If you did not do yet feel free to follow atalex_avoigt Youtube : You find complimentary videos on my Channel and if you subscribe and like you help to make my videos more visible for a broader audience. Referee Link:  Another way to support my work is to use my referral link in the case you make the good decision to buy a Tesla  https://ts.la/alexander23725 As a final note, my apologies for all mistakes I make in writing English. It's as you can tell not my mother tongue but I do my best to eliminate all errors."},

Die große und klügere Schwester meiner Texte auf Instagram.  Meine Kolumne ist wissenschaftlich, philosophisch und manchmal persönlich, anekdotisch.   Ich schreibe über mich, über andere und die Welt. Gerne kommentiere ich politische Ereignisse und ordne diese philosophisch ein. Da ich bei gesellschaftlich relevanten Themen immer wieder feststelle, mit wieviel Bauchgefühl und anekdotischer Evidenz Menschen an Urteile herangehen, bemühe ich mich um einen Blickwinkel, der über eine einfache Meinung hinausgeht und Fakten, Logik, Moral und Empathie beeinhaltet.  \nMeine Kolumnen-Themen reichen von allgemeinen Erklärungen philosophischer Theorien über die Kommentierung weltpolitischer Ereignisse bis hin zu persönlichen Geschichten, die ich versuche, in einen politischen Rahmen einzuordnen.   \nVor allem schreibe ich aber über das, was mich in diesem Moment beschäftigt.  Und hoffe, ihr findet das genauso interessant wie ich!"},

I want to make it clear that   all of my social media content will remain free , because I think making my knowledge, critiques, and wit accessible can help a lot of folks grow (including myself!).

I know a lot of folks have said they've learned a lot from me and have asked for ways to compensate me for that, so here's your chance! So, you might ask...  \"What is Patreon\"? Well, lemme answer, beloved. Patreon is a website that helps you support your favorite creators by giving you the option to make monthly donations. They can be as little as $1 a month to as much as $50 (in my case). You can cancel your subscription at ANY time. \"What do I get out of supporting your lil queer ass?\" A lot actually! Depending on your commitment, there's different rewards but some dope low cost ones are things like: access to exclusive posts, livestreams, bonus cuts from my videos and podcasts, as well as a look at my unreleased works of fiction! \"Damn, girl. I can't afford to give you shit 😕\"  AND THAT'S SUPER COOL. I don't expect ALL of my followers to donate to me, but I know I have many followers that can, and many more that have expressed desire to compensate me for my labor. Also, I never want folks to feel like they're making a sacrifice by supporting my work; I literally just want your chunk change if you have any to spare!🤷🏽 You can also support my work by  sharing my Patreon ( or having your school/community  book me  for a speaking gig by e-mailing me at:  [email protected] ) With your help I can hopefully fulfill my long term goal of being a full time indie creator!! I thank you so much in advance for even CONSIDERING giving me ANY amount. Side bar: if a one time donation is more your thing than a monthly subscription, you can hit up my other links. Honestly anything would be dope! Cash.me/$QXC Venmo: @xoxorubenangel"},

I have been a full-time writer, artist, musician, director and organiser for a long time.

I collaborate with a close-knit but hearty web of artists from across all mediums, whatever I feel serves the work really. The Kuini Qontrol project prioritises the narratives of:  mana wāhine (our radical women), indigenous thought worldwide, our wavy HQ Oceania, our LGBTQI/gender-diverse fam and underground creatives of colour.  I am proud to be creating on my terms, building images and archetypes, trying to empower (or at least entertain) my people, while moving culture and conversations where I feel I'm supposed to. \n \n \n A monthly Patreon koha (no matter how small) helps me independently create and focus on the projects, people and ideas that I think are important without the eye-rolling compromises.

These days I'm a bit more independent and I know how to futureproof and support myself better. Small Capricorn strategies like this Patreon are part of that.  \n \nAs the key catalyst of Kuini Qontrol, I want the freedom to make specialised, no-filter projects for audiences I love. I also want to share and pool resources with aligned people and communities that need it, as often as I can.  \n I have been using social media way less so making Patreon a more meaningful outlet for my ideas and news feels way better. I'll be making a newsletter/zine thing every 4-6 weeks on Patreon and probably the odd video if korero seems like a better fit. I update about lesser known events and share all firewalled work I do. I plan to make any music, inaccessible writing work, art, critique and news available first and for free. I of course plan to share with my public audience, but think being more transparent and experimental here feels safer.

This Patreon initially began in 2017 as an attempt to support and make space for work that was harder to find homes for, but for a lot of the last year and change it's really been more of a lifeline that at least guarantees I make rent.  One of the projects that's been percolating really since before I started this Patreon, that I'm looking to focus more energy on this year, is a book project around minerals, computation, and (for lack of a better word) faith. There's a lot of weird overlaps between the fetishizing of networked computation as instrument of salvation or enlightenment in the tech industry and the fetishizing of crystals as instruments of salvation or enlightenment in the wellness-industrial complex. I don't think that particular desire for certainty or comfort is itself misguided; it's what humans do all the time. Whether they'll find it in rocks or in computers made from rocks is maybe the questionable part. This is a  short video essay  made in 2019 about a piece of this project.  Supporting my work means you get the first look at the projects I'm working on and depending on what level you support at print versions of some of those projects. I'm also trying some exclusive content for Patreon supporters this year in the form of a little investigation project related to bodega supply chains in New York City. "},

Each reward cycle I'll release a new instructional video or PDF to hone your artistic skills and level up your portfolio. If you're looking for affordable art education that you can readily apply to improve your work, this is it. I love teaching art skills, and have been doing it for nearly 20 years, and Patreon gives me chance to reach a bigger audience than I ever could with local classes. If you don't have any good instructors in their your area, or they lack actual industry experience, that's why I'm here. How It Works Patreon is a subscription service, not unlike a monthly magazine. After joining, you'll begin receiving any new content released, but like a magazine, you will not receive all previous content. If you're interested in previous rewards, they are available in the  store . Payment processing and rewards are set to per-release basis. While I aim for new content to come out at the beginning of each month, sometimes due to my illustration workload, I have to skip a month. You will only be charged if new content is released. I'll keep you up-to-date with what I'm working on and what to expect. What To Do Click the \"Become A Patron\" button on the upper right then select the tier that has the rewards you want. Put in the information Patreon needs to work it's magic and click \"Confirm\". You are now a patron, welcome and thanks for joining! Even though you're a patron, you'll have to wait till your pledge is processed on the 1st of the  following  month before you have access to any rewards (that's how Patreon rolls). But then...you'll start receiving rewards through Patreon messages! Enjoy and share the art love :D Feedback \"Really well explained, your process makes so much sense.\" \"Great video! Learned a lot. Explains every step and detail.\" \"You explain very well. Your analogies help bring the point across.\" \"...your Patreon is a gold mine, THANK YOU!\""},

I’m Frances, an illustrator and artist, originally from rural north Lincolnshire and now working and living in Cambridge after completing a Masters in children’s book illustration. I have created this Patreon to have a space to share a bit more about my work and how I make it, if you’d like to take a look! I’ve been working on my art practice and sharing it through Instagram for a long time. It was only through starting my MA and the pandemic that I really turned to my sketchbooks for enjoyment as well as learning, which has helped me so much in developing my work. However, perhaps more importantly, it’s taught me what I enjoy making, how important experimentation is, and how valuable carving out a bit of time for myself and my practice is. The support of other wonderful creative people has been so valuable over this time, and I hope that I’ll be able to give you a little bit of that back through here. I've got two simple tiers, for the moment. For £3 per month you will be helping me through the work filled days by fuelling my caffeine habit, and in return I’ll add you to my close friends where I’ll be sharing more snippets of my day to day life and practice. For £8 a month, I’ll be sharing more in depth videos and posts as well. Expect content involving a lot of chat about materials (I’m a little obsessive), videos of my process on location, in my sketchbooks and illustrative work, and sometimes more informal ‘vlog’ style content, where I take you with me behind the scenes. If you’re still considering becoming a patron of me after reading all of this, thank you, it really does mean so much. "},

Zootopia body design will be preferred. Art Examples Story Sample:    She made an art form of avoiding him. If his life were normal, it might have been impressive and praiseworthy. She was always gone before he woke up, always managed to slip into the house late when he wasn’t looking. Not that he waited up for her, not that he stood by the window and wondered why her shifts were twice as long now; wondered why she never left her room or joined him for meals anymore. They weren’t in a relationship now, of that much he was certain. He had looked through the box again, paid extra close attention to every picture on her wall, checked drawers, dressers. He was beyond feeling bad enough rummaging through her house, mostly because he just needed to know the truth, and partly because he was sure that she had to know about it by now. There was no way she had not noticed his scent in her bed, yet she had said nothing. Simply remained locked away, silent aside from the occasional shuffle of paws across carpet or the sound of her shower running.     He tried to wait her out. He even left her little notes on the door, inside and out, telling her that he wanted to talk to her. But they remained unanswered. And every day that he was ignored, his heart sank a little lower. And every dip in his chest was followed by anger.  He  was the one who couldn’t remember anything beyond random flashes of memory that were too damned short to be helpful.  He  was the one whose head had been bashed in for a job that he couldn’t even remember so that he was forced to live with a damned rabbit that didn’t want anything to do with him!      He thought of leaving, going home, but couldn’t even find his home address because it always pointed back to her. Which confused him further, and the confusion only made him angry all over again. What kind of game did she think she was playing with him, anyway? So he’d smelled like a vixen, so what? He hadn’t even done anything with her, and even if he had spent the night with her in some seedy hotel just to blow off some steam and finally have some fucking relaxation in his life, so what? They obviously weren’t anything anymore, if they ever had been. He had not dismissed the possibility that it had been a one-time thing for her, a quick roll with a fox just to find out what it was like.       Which brought him back to being confused,  again,  because if that was the case why was she so angry?       He heard the shower turn off, again. For the past seven days, he had heard that sound, waited quietly in front of the TV in the hopes that she would come out and maybe even glance in his direction to show that she gave even a little bit a damn about him. Nothing. Again. Just a few silent footfalls, the sound of her crawling into bed, and then nothing again. His paw tightened on the carrot pen he held until he felt the plastic start to groan in protest, a paw that shook when he relaxed his grip enough to slide it into his pocket as he stood.      He considered doing a lot of things. A lot of them were stupid ideas, and he knew it. The first to come and easiest to dismiss was the fleeting idea to go out and find a vixen, take her to bed and give the damned rabbit something to be mad about at least. And after nearly punching himself for the thought, which he knew was just mean and spiteful, he pushed aside ideas of finding Finnick again to vent on, calling his mother, just going for a walk, and calling the ZPD to get his home address so he could leave. All of the thoughts fluttered away when he realized that he was standing at her door with one paw raised, and before he could gain control of the rage of confused pain that had brought him here, he pounded it into the door three times quickly.     “Judy, we need to talk, damn it!” (Full Story Here:  One Hundred Percent )"},

I'm Kathleen, an illustrator and writer from Brisbane, Australia. I was raised on fairy tales in Western Queensland, and now I'm  allowed  to draw in other people's books. (You might also know me as Tanaudel on my  blog , Twitter  and  Instagram , and from my webcomic a few years back,  The Dalek Game ). My  art  has also been shortlisted a few times for the World Fantasy Award and in 2018 I was nominated for a Hugo! WHY: I'm in the early days of a \"portfolio career\", keeping my head above water by illustrating, writing, teaching and 'related activities'. But this severely limits the time I can spend on my own projects, on learning and gathering inspiration, creating new art, and just  playing  with pictures. Some of the things I want to be able to do are to keep sharing my monthly fairy/folk tale-ish  calendar  page, sketching at festivals and airshows, illustrating my own tiny stories and, yes, drawing  Daleks . This is where you come in! Your support means all these projects have a chance to exist and, I hope, contribute to the sum total of beauty and stories in the world. WHAT I MAKE and YOU GET: A monthly calendar page that you can print at home (to colour in or pre-coloured by me). Bits of pictures and snippets of story. At higher levels of support, I'll be able to make webcomics and little illustrated. Behind-the-scenes details and sneak-peeks of other art projects. Process posts and, depending on which goals are met, maybe even process videos. Advance information on sales, and depending on levels and websites, discounts on prints. HOW: Your support and involvement will buy me the time (and caffeine) I need to make all this art. The images on this page are all works that have been created with the help of my patrons. Who knows what else could happen? "},

Thanks for stopping by my little corner of Patreon. There’s a whole host of treats for you here, and a wonderful little community to boot. I feel that few things bring people together like graves, ghosts and miserable Victorians, so here’s my little pitch. I’d love to have you on board. What exactly is Patreon? Patreon is a great way to support your favourite creators; by becoming a patron of Burials and Beyond, you get immediate access to a huge archive of posts, including articles, videos, podcasts, guides…the list goes on. You can also interact with the clubhouse and chat with me and other patrons! Your support allows me to continue creating content, pursue my passions and reach more people. For that, I cannot thank you enough. So what’s on here? I update Patreon four times a week with a fun mix of content and media. With topics as far-ranging as Tamagotchi cemeteries and questionable Victorian mediums, there’ll always be something curious to tickle your fancy! Most of the content on here is exclusive to Patreon, never to be made publicly available. I appreciate your interest and support enormously, so – regardless of tier - everyone who signs up gets full access to everything.  As of August 2021, patrons get access to the following: Long Form Articles You want essays about mourning practices, cemeteries, myths, legends, psychics and uncommon history? Every week, a new topic is covered with humour and thorough research, bringing you a whole host of topics you never knew you needed to know about.  Videos Fun videos are uploaded regularly, encompassing a whole host of topics and formats. Here, you’ll find video lectures on topics such as ‘An Introduction to Victorian Spiritualism’ and ‘Victorian Mourning Jewellery’, alongside cemetery tours, show and tells, storytelling and fascinating in-depth interviews. In the series ‘Talking to Interesting People’, we chat to a host of interesting people, from perfumers to Victorian hair workers, extravagant antiques dealers, professional comedians and filmmakers to collectors of the weird and wonderful.  Podcasts Exclusive to Patreon, ‘Thoughts from the Graveyard’ is a weekly, chatty podcast where I share thoughts, stories and moral quandaries. In 2021, we’ve discussed far-reaching themes, such as the ethics of owning human remains to the forgotten stories of death cheese. Collection Features After a lifetime of collecting unusual items and mourning ephemera, I often pick out a piece – whether that be a Spiritualist poster, a mourning card or a 100-yr old memo on prison burials – and present its strange history and place in our world.  Guides Ever wondered what all those symbols on gravestones mean? Unsure what Victorian mediums actually did? As of Aug ’21, we have two ongoing guides, with more to come: Cemetery Symbolism and a Short Guide to Spiritualism. Short Form Articles Not all reads have to be of essay length! Every week, we have short-form posts on a variety of subjects. For example, Grave Matters tell the story of famous or unusual graves whereas the Mourning Jewellery Spotlight series looks at the intricacies of ‘morbid’ jewellery of yesteryear. Any long-form articles that are to be transferred to the public website are made available to patrons generally 2-3 months in advance! How long have you been at this then? Since 2017, I have been posting to burialsandbeyond.com with informative and light-hearted articles about life, death and the weird bits in-between. While this has been a lot of fun, with my strange and deathly writing appearing in Vice, Haunted Magazine and Fortean Times but to name a few, I’ve longed to build a fun and varied community. Patreon is that vibrant little community. Since 2021, I’ve been fully committed to the world of Patreon and have loved how much it’s grown. I’d be so thrilled to have you on board. If you read to the end, double thanks to you! I’d love to have you as a clubhouse member, so sign up today and let me show you my skulls… Kate xx Burials and Beyond"},

Perhaps you've met others like me who are on the same post-Evangelical journey so many are on. If not, then that's cool, too. Nevertheless, I'm glad you're here. I'm glad you've taken a moment to check out my Patreon page, and I hope that I can be of some help to you as you sojourn through the desert of life. So, you're probably wondering: How can we partner up? Well, it's really easy. And depending on what you are looking for (as well as how much you have to spend on this type of shit), I've set up multiple tiers for you to check out. Which means, the more you contribute, the more cool stuff you're gonna get, from memes to videos, even eBooks and personal discussion sessions. Pretty cool, right? So, before you leave, make sure to check out the various tiers to see if any fit with what you are looking for. And remember, walk in peace, live life to the fullest, and be a light to a hurting world. Shalom, friends. Matthew J. Distefano"},

Antisemitism presents itself as liberational and it associates Jews with oppression and injustice. As well as being a danger to Jews it is also corrosive of wider democratic values. The London Centre is a creative, combative and energetic hub of thinking and research. It recognises antisemitism and it critiques it rigorously and relentlessly. David Hirsh, David Seymour, Lesley Klaff, Philip Spencer, Daniel Allington, Anthony Julius and their colleagues need your support. They undermined the boycotters, they presented the evidence about Corbyn, they unravelled the apartheid smears and the Nazi analogies.

I am a first generation Xicana Indigena woman. I am an Intuitive whose magick revolves around art, intuitive poetry as well as intuitive Tarot/ Oracle readings. My intuition is fueled by meditation, decolonizing, learning the path of my Ancestors and their stories. Through these magickal rituals and intuition I birth art, poetry and guided messages utilizing the Tarot and Oracle, as well as astrology and moon phases.  I started sharing my words and illustrations on social media as a way of healing generational trauma, internalized trauma and as a way of coming back to my roots. I didn't know how to connect to my ancestors because colonization is so deep that it has taken away much of my history. Poetry and art served as a portal to start drafting visions and crafting words that came straight from Spirit, straight from the Divine, straight from my Ancestors and Guides. When this path discovered me, it was then that I knew this was the way that I would start redrawing my life and rewording my life to a way that I see it best fit rather than what society and colonialism forced upon me. I wish to expand my offerings that are more rooted in divination and guidance through a creative lens. These offerings are all offerings I've been led by Spirit to offer. They are all offerings that have given me so much clarity, healing and connection and now they are here to support you in your connection wether it be to yourself, Spirit, Ancestors and Guides. I invite you to be part of this sacred circle here on my Patreon.

When the Christmas season is over, things really slow down (some months almost completely) and I need to live off of my savings until the next Christmas season, when I can build it back up for the next year.

As a result I find that I tend to spend too much time worrying about \"selling\" and not enough time \"creating\".  A while back I was talking with my wife, saying that in the old days, a wealthy patron of the arts would support an artist, so that they can focus on creating instead of surviving. But things are a bit different now. Enter Patreon. In today's world, you no longer need to be wealthy to be a patron of the arts. I choose to keep this subscription at only $1 a month. I plan to offer much more value in return. I do not want to live off of the charity of others, I wish to make this more than worth it for you! I will work to give you valuable content that you will want. Guaranteed monthly downloads, and sometimes more often. All for a dollar a month!

I hope you will join me on this journey so every Patron ends up with something cool to print.  \n What will you get? \n Welcome pack -   This pack contains  Kes  project (the barbarian warrior on the left of the top image). As time goes by, I will add more models to the welcome pack. Full 3D model STL File -  At the beginning of each month I release a full 3D model in STL file format. You will get a download link available for the entire month. The model is made of different parts with keys for easy assembly. The subject of the model can vary a lot, you can expect fearless warriors, evil queen, samouraï, sorcerer, high-tech soldier, and sexy gorgeous girls to name a few. Some models may come with options (a different weapon for example) and some will have a Not Safe For Work (NSFW) version when appropriate. The normal scale of each model is 1:6 but you can easily scale down the print for 1:10 scale for example. NSFW Anatomy Studies  - I will also include in the month release the anatomy study I did for the main character. The character will obviously be naked and printable. The anatomy files can be a good way to practice skin painting or have a reference for drawing. \n \n \n\t Work In progress  - I share with you my process with images that I post throughout the month. \n \n \n\t 25% Discount on my  gumroad store  - At the beginning of each month I'll post a discount code that is valid for the entire month. \n\t Vote for the next project -  I think sharing with you my ideas for the next project is a cool thing to do. I will post pictures of what I have in mind so you got to choose between 3 subjects each month. The winner is what I will be working on the following month.  \n \n \n"},

Bio Adeem Maria (they/them) is a seventh-generation Carolinian, a makeshift poet, singer-songwriter, storyteller, and blue-collar Artist. Blending a homegrown affection for Country Music with the emotional turmoil of alternative folk in the early aughts, they have created a unique brand of Americana that pays homage to John Prine and John Darnielle (of The Mountain Goats) in equal parts.  Imbued with the ancestral traces of southern music and colored by a palette ranging from lo-fi anti-folk to post-punk, the songs traverse the vast compass of human emotion. Whether opining on the disparity of “hooch” and “booch” in the collision of generations or straddling the duality of being a “blue collar boy” who is a “complicated dame,” Adeem excavates unwonted stories of the forgotten south.

I'm some nerd who spends way, way too much time drawing comics about pretty much anything. I also dabble in programming, animation, tutorial writing, generalized writing... I do a lot of stuff. I also work on a somewhat weekly fancomic called Handplates you might have heard of. A few people asked me if there was some way they could support what I do, so I finally decided to bite the bullet and set this up. Maybe you have a couple bucks to toss my way, maybe not. I'll keep on trucking either way. Here's a more thorough breakdown of the tiers if you're curious. --- 1$ - If you like what I do and want to toss me a buck in appreciation, this is the tier for you! You have my gratitude and thanks for your generosity, haha. I know how valuable your money is to you, and I'm honored you want to pay me for what I do! 3$ - If you want to toss me more than a buck, but not quite five bucks, then here's your tier! You will get my gratitude just as in the previous tier, and I'll give you a quick heads-up about what I'm going to post the next day. So you might get a quick \"Tomorrow will be: A comic\" or a Handplates page, or a fake screenshot, or a piece of music, or a music video, or a sprite, or something like that. So you'll have an idea of what's coming! 5$ - If you want to support what I do and get some kind of reward for doing so, maybe this tier will be more your speed? For five bucks, you'll get screencaps of whatever it is I'm working on that day before I go to sleep. In many cases, this can mean seeing things possibly weeks in advance! You may also get sneak peeks at secret projects I may have in the works, like animations, ghost stuff, fics, videos, sprites, works-in-progress... it could be anything! Provided I did something that day of course... 10$ - Maybe a screencap isn't enough for you, or you've still got some cash to burn? For ten bucks, you'll get the full finished image of whatever I'm working on when it's done! So again, that means you might see comics or finished things weeks in advance! You'll also get full shots of any WIPs in question, like Handplates pages for example. If there's a comic I've taken down that you want to see again, you can also get access to those! If I still have the files, anyway... 20$ - Woah dude, first, thank you??? You're incredibly generous, haha. For twenty bucks, you'll get the WIP previews, finished images as soon as they're done, and access to my back catalogue of art! I've built up an enormous amount of material over the years, and a lot of it isn't even up in public places anymore for various reasons. This catalogue will be split into categories and types so you can more specifically ask me for anything you want to see. This includes sketchbook pages too! 50$ - First, woah again, this is nuts that you'd want to support me like this, haha. You'll get all the previous benefits, and each month, you'll get a quick sketch request! This tier will be limited because I don't know how well I'll be able to handle this on top of other things, but I hopefully will be able to handle one/two characters, depending. I know that might not seem like much, but I don't want to burn myself out with this and everything else! I hope you understand, haha. 100$ - You can imagine me boggling at this number, haha. Thank you! Like before, you'll get all the previous benefits except instead of a sketch request a month, you'll get a colored sketch request a month! I should be able to handle one/two colored characters with a simple bg, but we'll see. It depends on what you have in mind! This tier will also be limited so I don't swamp myself... --- Those are all the tiers right now! If there's demand for higher tiers (!?!) then I may add some depending. I'm not sure what other rewards I could conceivably offer... well, if you do want to pledge more, send me a message and I'll see what I can do. I am a bit new to this, so please be patient while I sort all of this out! --- You can find me in other places at... Deviantart  -  Tumblr  -  Twitter  -  AOOOOO  -  Pillowfort  -  Ashido.com"},

Finn (my husband):  No, that's not true. If what you did was just you and swords it wouldn't last. The people you sword with are joy.... ---- Hey Y'all! I am so very excited about this new project and want to get you involved!. For the past three years I have been researching and writing a new book -  initially based in my research on medieval wrestling and fighting, and which came to encompass medieval forms of concept organization and analysis, as well as hunting traditions in 15th century Germany. The ultimate goal of this is, of course, synthesizing the results and using them to inform how we use swords in the 21st century - with the goal of doing so in a way that is as close as to 15th century technique as we can get.  The struggle I have had is determining the best method to get this information out to people.  While books are great for many forms of information, a conversation is better for this particular kind of information.  So here is what I want to do, in a short version: Connect with the community of people interested in the kind of research I do; Share ideas of how to interpret and perform 15th century fight techniques; Learn what practitioners of Liechtenauer's art need in the realm of class planning, student development, and daily practice;  Continue writing up my research in blog, article, and book form, and share this information first and foremost with those who have helped me complete the research; Produce videos and share with my crew; and Set up regular group video-chat, video-training sessions from my training hall where we can ask questions and share ideas.  ---- Why do I need a Patreon to do this?  Can't I just do this without asking for money? In short: NO.  The reason I have been able to do so much work on medieval fighting to date is that my husband Finn has a successful career in a very demanding field and when we decided to have a family, I chose to leave the standard workplace and \"stay home\" with my kids.  Because of this, I am no longer on the traditional career ladder.  Not working for an employer has given me the opportunity to do things like watch kids play at the park while I read or write about medieval sources.  I have been afforded many opportunities to travel and share my interpretations and ideas.  While I am so thoroughly grateful for all of these moments, what many students of historical martial arts may not realize is that teaching at a HEMA seminar is rarely a paying gig.  More often than not, an event can only offer a flat fee that comes close to covering travel costs.  Once you work out the cost in time of hours spent forgoing other opportunities and real money out of pocket for taxis, food, and shipping armor, it typically costs my family money for me to go and teach.  But this, my friends, is my passion: studying, sharing, and community. I have reached a place where I want to give more.  I want to connect with more of you, share my ideas in better ways, and get the results of my research to y'all faster.  To do that, I need your help to make it possible.  If this sounds like your jam, and you're interested in joining a very focused community to discuss 15th century German martial arts, please go have a look at the patron tiers and consider becoming par pf the crew."},

I plan to convey working-style home recordings from here, perhaps in a similar vein to the   Monarcana  album. I love sharing the (edited) unedited (less edited?) mind!  With Patreon I also look forward to drawing in elements of the musical teaching style I've been developing in recent years. I love to speak and skill-share about singing, songwriting, playing piano and guitar, and encouraging people to live musical lives. You'll find that tiers D, E, and F include workshops; the final tier F also offers 1:1 coaching if that's of interest. I'm excited to give this a go; there are many ways you can join me! \n\nFrom the Big Heart, \nDiane -- website:  dianecluck.info latest album:  Common Wealth bandcamp:  dianecluck.bandcamp.com insta:  @dianecluckofficial"},

Je m’appelle Julie Beauzac et j’ai créé en décembre 2019  Vénus s’épilait-elle la chatte , un podcast au nom élégant qui s’interroge sur les mécanismes de domination au sein de l’histoire de l’art occidentale  : pourquoi les musées sont remplis de femmes à poil, pourquoi on admire de si nombreuses scènes de viol, et pourquoi les grands génies sont quasiment tous des hommes.  L’idée est de comprendre que l’histoire de l’art, bien qu’elle soit sacralisée par une tradition assez classiste, n’est pas intouchable et que, au même titre que la littérature et la pop culture, elle n’est jamais « neutre » et mérite d’être interrogée pour mieux  comprendre comment nos regards se sont construits .  Vénus s’épilait-elle la chatte  est un  podcast accessible  à toustes, même aux personnes qui ne connaissent rien à l’histoire de l’art. POURQUOI SOUTENIR VÉNUS ?  Soutenir un podcast indépendant Vénus s’épilait-elle la chatte est un podcast  totalement autoproduit . Depuis 1 an il y a ponctuellement de la publicité sur les épisodes, mais  les possibilités de partenariats publicitaires sont restreintes  car j’ai envie de mettre uniquement en avant des marques qui proposent des produits ou des services réellement utiles, fabriqués ou mis en œuvre dans des conditions éthiques. Rémunérer toutes les personnes qui le font exister Comme  le travail payé c'est bien,  je rémunère toutes les personnes qui participent au podcast grâce à leurs  compétences spécifiques : mixage, prise de son, doublage, lectures, traductions,   transcriptions,  etc. Ces rémunérations, l’achat de livres et de matériel (micros, disques durs, cartes SD, etc), l’hébergement du podcast et du site sont financées à 30% par les revenus publicitaires et à 70% sur mes fonds propres. Pour continuer et développer le podcast, j’ai besoin qu'il m'apporte un revenu suffisant pour  financer ces investissements .  Garantir sa qualité et le faire durer dans le temps Rendre le podcast payant n’est pas envisageable parce que ça irait à l’encontre de sa raison d’être, c’est-à-dire  vulgariser des connaissances et les rendre accessibles . Par ailleurs, produire un contenu à la fois documenté et accessible prend énormément de temps, et je n'ai pas envie de faire plus d’épisodes de moindre qualité pour avoir plus d’écoutes et attirer potentiellement plus de sponsors. C’est ici que le Patreon prend tout son sens. Il s’agit d’un système d’abonnement qui donne  accès à du contenu exclusif,  et permet aux personnes qui en ont les moyens et l’envie de soutenir mon travail, pour  faire de Vénus un projet réellement viable dans le temps ❤️"},

Music has been my primary hustle for most of my life. I had nearly 30 years time-served with the award winning internationally touring group  Blackfire . About 7 years ago I was at a crossroads where it was clear that a guitar wasn't going to stop bulldozers. I was trying to balance my organizing to  protect sacred places  with being on the road for 80% of the year. So I put down the pen and guitar and dove head on into (dis)organizing. You see, since 2001 I've been involved in founding and maintaining a bunch of volunteer projects such as;  Indigenous Action Media ,  Táala Hooghan Infoshop,   Outta Your Backpack Media ,  Protect the Peaks , and more, so there was a lot to focus on other than my more creative crafts. Over the years I've made more than 6 albums and two feature films, dozens of short films, and written zines and countless articles (some published in books). I've also had my artwork in a handful of galleries and museums with an upcoming show at the end of this year. You can check out some of that work here:  www.kleebenally.com . A lot of this has been work I've produced in-between organizing campaigns for groups such as  Haul No!  and  Clean Up The Mines . I have so many projects on the back-burner so I am ready to unleash a mass wave of creative production with your support. Enter Patreon and you! Music, film & art are my passions but I can't focus on consistently producing new work without material (read financial) support. I see Patreon as an opportunity to build a community of support and a team (if you will) that can help me and those I collaborate with build more effective agitative work.  Patreon is a crowdfunding platform to support creative endeavors and production via monthly financial pledges. You can set how much you wish to donate each month, and can cancel anytime. At this point I've devised some tiers of rewards for patrons but you can contribute any amount, and anything will definitely be greatly appreciated.  I see this as an experiment where I can connect and re-connect with folx who enjoy and support my fiercely independent creations so I can create more.  I'm planning on offering a range of dynamic things here, from music downloads, songwriting workshops, behind the scenes blogs & videos, first-looks & pre-sales, exclusive contests, recognition (your name in places), and much more.  With all this blah blah blah about music & art I want to be clear that I'm not stopping or taking a step back from organizing, but that your support through this platform will assist me in doing more of the things more effectively. Sign up and let's get this fire started! with fierce love & rage, Klee"},

I’m an Aquarius, born in San Antonio, Texas, and — apart from maybe the seven or eight years before I “stole” my older sister Tammi’s guitar out from under her bed — I’ve been playing, singing, and writing music my entire life. I’ve been fortunate enough to be able to make a living doing it since around 1990. Through lean times and high times and all kinds of times in between, my childhood love of writing and performing my own songs (in part because I could almost never remember the words to other people’s songs) has sustained me financially, emotionally, and even physically. It’s taken me all over the country and overseas, introduced me to thousands of friendly faces (and friends!), and ultimately allowed me to “own my own universe.”  I released my debut album,  Two Dollar Shoes , way back in 1996. After three different “major” labels sent me rejection letters, I decided to just put the album out myself. It’s now 25 years later, and all three of those other labels have long since gone out of business, but I’m still here, with 20 albums to my name and I own the masters to every single one of them.  I was diagnosed with epilepsy in my early 20s, meaning I’ve lived with and managed a seizure disorder my entire career. Much more recently — in 2020 — I was diagnosed with spasmodic dysphonia and an essential vocal tremor. With intensive vocal therapy and an arsenal of breathing techniques, some dating back to my classical music training in high school and college, I am still able to talk, sing, perform, and even record. But I don’t take any of it for granted. What’s more, I also made my mind up a long time ago to not just take a proactive stance against any adversity I face health wise, but to do everything in my power to turn it all into a positive. Which is why I’ve invested so much time and passion over the last decade into building something that in the big picture is more important to me than my own music career. A few years back, I launched a 501 C3 non-profit called the OYOU, as in “Own Your Own Universe.” Its mission: To make the arts accessible to everyone, regardless of age, gender, income, or physical mobility, and to empower and transform lives by connecting the mind, body, and spirit through music and creative arts.  As hard as it’s been at times to do what I do while living with a seizure disorder, I believe and know for a fact that playing music, as much as if not more so than any medication, is what has allowed me to actually live with that condition. I’ve also witnessed firsthand how creating, sharing, and experiencing art can have a profoundly positive impact on others living with all kinds of different physical, neurological, emotional, and social challenges.  Since its launch back in 2012, the OYOU has hosted countless workshops, retreats, children’s music camps, concert series, support groups, monthly song circles, and myriad other events at various locations throughout Central Texas — and, since 2017, on the grounds of Wilory Farm, the OYOU’s official headquarters in Martindale. I actually purchased the property — 12 acres straddling both Hays and Guadalupe County — myself, after selling my own longtime home in nearby San Marcos, cashing in my equity, and taking out a loan. I did this so that the OYOU could have a permanent base of operations and plenty of room to grow without ever being charged a dime for rent, utilities, or property taxes. Low overhead is crucial to the longevity of a nonprofit. In addition, the green space serves as a vital backdrop to keeping aspiring artists of all ages inspired ad engaged.  For the record (pun intended), “Wilory Farm” was also the name of my second album, released in 1998. And in case you were wondering or didn’t already know, yes, I named my record label Wilory, too. It’s all in tribute to a late friend of mine, a wonderful teacher, musician, and philanthropist named Marion Williamson. Marion, who was the owner of the original Wilory Farm, took me under her wing when I was in my early 20s and just beginning to find my calling as a performing songwriter. And in exchange for me helping her milk her goats, it was Marion who literally taught me how to “own my own universe.”  As big and positive an impact that she had on me, though, Marion wasn’t alone. Because the fact is, a lot of people have helped me on my journey every step of the way. My first album was financed by way of personal loans from a handful of close friends, loans that I was able to pay back with interest within just a few months after the record came out. And when a whole bunch of those CDs needed assembling the day of my official CD release show at Gruene Hall, friends stepped up like pros. It was also with the help of friends that I was able to start mailing list (back before email!), and because of that mailing list, for years and years I was able to cover the expenses for every new album I made through CD pre-sales on my website’s e-commerce store alone. You could say I was “crowd funding” and running \"Wilory FarmHands\" long before crowd funding even became a thing. So as proud as I am to have been an independent artist my entire career, believe me when I say this has never been a one-woman show. Just like the OYOU, which I can’t even imagine existing without the help of our volunteers, teachers, and a board of directors as passionate about the mission as I am, my music career was built on — and still runs on — teamwork.  I still wake up every morning with a sense of purpose — call it a mission — to use my music and life's work to do good in the world. And I do it because I still can, thanks in large part, as always, to my invaluable team of supporters and friends. In other words, thanks to YOU my Wilory FarmHands.  A few years back, I was honored to have my archives accepted into the care of the esteemed Witliff Collections at Texas State University in San Marcos. And with the Witliff’s help, I can now share those newly digitized archives with you here. I’m talking literally 30 years worth of live recordings from every stage of my career, along with studio outtakes, radio sessions, demo tapes, and even video. And of course I’ll be sharing lots of brand new exclusive content here, too. In addition, Wilory FarmHands will have first hand updates and posts on happenings here at Wilory Farm or with my music and writing.  Because of my health, I will never be able to tour like I once did. I accept this. Shows will be limited. But this page will serve as a conduit between me and my fanbase all over the world. Honestly, the music business has changed — especially with streaming taking over record sales. But I've changed, too. I'm ready for the change. I'm ready to be the change. I'll play a few select shows a year, but through this page, I'm certain I can maintain an even healthier relationship with my fanbase and perhaps even garner new fans for years to come.  Every dollar collected through this site not only enables me to continue to have a career in the arts, but it also helps pay for ongoing upkeep and renovation projects here at Wilory Farm. By working and contributing  together as Wilory FarmHands, we can all play a role in helping me build Wilory Farm Center for the Creative Arts inspiring generations of new artists for years to come.  I also wanted to add, that because I personally purchased what has become Wilory Farm Center for the Creative Arts, I have intentionally kept it separate from all finances having to do with the OYOU. No funds from this Patreon page or \"Live from Wilory Farm\" are used on the 501 C3 nonprofit, \"Own Your Own Universe (OYOU). Therefore, contributions from this page are not tax deductible. Simply put, this page funds me personally and enables me to continue with my life's work and ongoing mission with my music. That mission, is to use my music to create good in this world. Every single day.  Thank you for your support! I remain humbled and grateful!\n Best Wishes,\n Terri Hendrix "},

Thank you for taking the time to connect with me here! It is deeply meaningful to me that you are interested in my life's work: creating awareness training through custom made meditation sequencing, ritual design, feral witchcraft, and self-inquiry through tarot.  How it works: by enrolling in a tier you join my daily spiritual services that include two xematiasma(evil eye removal practice), healing and lifespan extending practice, removal of obstacles, and blessings for general wellbeing, comfort, and happiness. you get free tarot readings (depending on tier)  optional ritual crafting, psychic support for your own workings, and exclusive access to patron-only live rituals and products Where the content is coming from: I have always been interested in ritual: at the age of 11 I was trained in the traditional methods of diagnosing and treating the evil-eye(xematiasma), and the reading of playing cards (and sometimes coffee grounds) based on Greek and Roma folk traditions by my grandmother Demetra and grandaunt Evangelia, and that study and practice never ended. My mother's collection of books on modern witchcraft, yoga, meditation and ritual were a source of great inspiration and the basis of my first ritual designs. In fact- my very first paying job (I was 15) was as a card reader and spirit channel at a small new age store a few minutes from my childhood home. Throughout high school and college I immersed myself in the study of ritual practice and meditation: Witchcraft, Tarot, shamanism, ceremonial magic, and tantric yoga.  In 1996 that study led me to ordain as a Buddhist monk (Tibetan tradition), and for 10 years I delighted in exploring the beautiful and sophisticated meditations and ritual practices of Tantric Buddhism. During that time I started taking yoga classes in Cambridge, MA, and saw an opportunity to share my love for ritual in a secular setting. I eventually became a yoga instructor and then a teacher of yoga teachers. This is when I created my 'Intentional Placement' meditation sequencing formula. Originally taught as a two hour workshop; the content has expanded and taken on a life of it's own- for the past several years I have been training people (mostly yoga teachers in teacher trainings) in the art of intentional meditation sequencing. This method of meditation instruction offers all the tools of the classical teachings, but without any religious or philosophical focus: allowing my clients to create custom made meditation sequences suited to their inclinations, individual needs, and beliefs.  Now I am offering my services at  The Cauldron Black  in Salem MA, and for those of you cannot get to Salem: you can connect with me here. I will be live broadcasting Feral Yoga classes, meditations, and rituals. I will be posting some of my writing and ritual work for patrons only!  So any of you interested in the book on feral yoga and witchcraft I've been working on- this is where you will get to see that content first.  Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you'll connect with me regarding any questions, comments, feedback, and requests. The nature of my work is continuously evolving, and your experiences are incredibly valuable to me.

I like to simplify concepts into easy to understand building blocks that\nwill strengthen your skills. \n\nI’ll also give studio tips, art material reviews,\nand whatever else art related that we want to talk about. The possibilities are endless and the site\nwill be a collaboration between us.  \n\n \n\n ● I promise to post at least twice a\nmonth.  \n\n● I promise to keep the lessons\ninformational, entertaining and short. \n\n● I promise to teach a variety of subjects\nusing video lessons, blog postings, downloadable handouts and demos. \n\n● I promise to listen to your\nfeedback which will help me design future lessons.  \"Evening Song\" 16 x 20 Oil \n\n \n\nPatreon is a subscription service (like Netflix)\nwhere you pay a monthly fee.

I have been doing VFX (visual effects) since forever and in the actual present I also make many different type of videos on demand. Whatever many different things I do in in my life, they all have an important principle in common: to do what you love and share the journey with people. Thats why I make video-tutorials about Visual Effects, and probably surely you arrived here because of this. WHAT I DO I like the idea of self-challenging myself in remaking impossible blockbuster movie's scenes directly on my pc using Blender!  And thats why I launched a series called BLENDER CINEMA, in which I remake glorious scenes from various movies entirely by myself. This is interesting for you because for every episode that I make, I always make also tutorials on how I achieved that! If you are here you probably surely know that I have a huge passion for VFX. In particular, I use mostly Blender for combining real footages with 3D / CGI. My aim is to achieve high level results, and I also like to help people in doing so! Thats why I make detailed tutorials on how to achieve simple and powerful VFX at your home!

We now represent the newest link in an unbroken 600-year-old tradition of artists pursuing truth and beauty through the direct observation of nature.  This year, over 500 students will pass through our studios, and 50 will study in our highly selective four-year Core Program. Under the leadership of Jacob Collins and the guidance of a faculty of dedicated artists, this program has consistently produced the world’s most skilled contemporary realist painters, draftsmen and sculptors. To support this rising generation of working artists, we have established a resident artist program, a gallery, and a series of public and private events including chamber music concerts and a lecture series. Each dollar we earn will go directly back to the GCA in support of scholarships, artists residencies and more. The Grand Central Atelier is recognized as a nonprofit organization under Chapter 501(c) 3  of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.

We're constantly trying to push the boundaries of what is possible for us, so we moved on from simple ingame recordings to more complex producing methods. In 2013  we created our first Machinima , followed by more and more unit promotions. We  tried out other games  , but ultimately sticked to big stompy robots. With \"This is Mechwarrior: Online\" we reached out to a broader audience and won the MechCon Machinima award 2016.    Why this Patreon    Following an almost 4 year long hiatus, we are back in action and have grown a lot. We launched this Patreon to give you a better look behind our scenes and involve the community into our projects. Making 3D Animations and Rendering them is quite costly still.

I've been selling my artwork at various  comic conventions   and  artist alleys   across Canada and the US since 2011! I work from home creating all kinds of art, teach art a few times a year (occasionally using what I picked up from my high school art teaching degree), and I work a  part-time desk job  at a recreation facility. In the past I've appeared on podcasts with the  Sleepycabin  crew, and I'm very active within the  Newgrounds  community, allowing me to work with numerous prominent artists, animators, and game developers! If all goes well, I hope to be a  full-time, independent artistfor the long term. Being able to  make   art   my  primary focus  in life is something that I've always dreamed of doing, and thanks to the current  global pandemic , I'm doing just that! ... But only temporarily. My part-time job is shut down for the moment (no re-opening date yet), and artist alleys are on hold (until who knows when) since they are usually huge high-risk social gatherings. With both of these jobs shut down, I turned to  Patreon ! ....That's where  you  come in! Using Patreon as a monthly  'tip jar' , your generous donations will go straight towards making art my  full-time focus,  long term . Permanently. No more part-time job! Slowly but surely, I'll  build up a sustainable, productive structure for myself here, and abandon the non-art part-time job completely! DREAM ACHIEVED. Proceeds from your hard-earned donations will also help me create merchandise like  original artwork ,  prints ,  coasters ,  stickers ,  enamel  pins ,  tote bags , and all kinds of other neat stuff! Have a look below at the  rewards  you'll get in return for  supporting  my work:"},

What I value most in the the whole world is the time I have to create.  Your subscription to my Patreon will ensure that I can protect and nourish that time, and wake up every day knowing I'll be able to draw AND afford my bills this month. Thanks to this page, for the first time in my life, I have sustainable monthly income. I don't know quite how to articulate how much that means for my creativity and overall mental health, but just know, it's a whole lot! Also, I just really really wanna get to know you guys better! My favorite part of posting my art over the past couple of years has been finding this incredible corner of the internet filled with such affecting enthusiasm, sincerity, and love for art and story. I’m hoping this page will take on a similar energy, and form a little community of wizard chats, artistic growth, and mutual support. And just give me a much needed excuse to talk to you more and get your input throughout the process of creating new illustrations!  Your pledges will help me to grow my online store, take care of my first dog, pay my rent, buy groceries, but most excitingly! They will give me the peace of mind to grow as an artist, and a human, and continue to create the work that you want to see, and I love to make."},

I have paintings in publications and private collections worldwide, and was nominated in the Best Artist Category in the World Fantasy Awards. In her book on the importance of reclaiming wildness in childhood - Kith - the writer Jay Griffiths said: “Rima Staines – the best illustrator of the realm of faërie, oak-smoked, sad-strung but vital that I have ever seen.” I have been an artist from the very beginning, and this work - creating imagery drawn from the unseen storied otherworlds that lie just alongside this one - is intrinsic to who I am and why I'm here. Perhaps you encountered my work through the blog I wrote for some years between 2008 and 2015, or by coming across my wayside art stall as I have travelled the towns and villages, fairs and festivals of the UK. Other people being part of my journey, following my travels, buying my artwork, encouraging and supporting me, has made  all the difference  to how my work has appeared in the world. Though I am fairly shy by nature and protective of unfinished works still skinless in their gestation, I have learned that being an artist is only half of a conversation. I am one half, and you are the other. There is no point in me creating what I do without people to receive it. The magic occurs in the handing-over, and in the response returned. This alchemy is something I have painted and written about, and which fascinates me deeply. How the work an artist creates can effect real and tangible change within the heart and being of another is a precious and profound phenomenon and a task I take very seriously. But this task changes form throughout the life of an artist and becomes more urgent, or harder to manifest depending on your circumstances... I have been juggling the seemingly incompatible balls of motherhood and artisthood for seven years now, and over the past three, I have been handed the incomprehensible challenge of epilepsy on top of this. Throughout these years I have held onto my art making as a lighthouse on dark seas, even when it hasn’t been possible to make as much as I once did.   As a child I grew up with artist-parents, surrounded by the conviction that making beautiful imagery was an important and valid life-path. I got to watch my parents make art as they raised us, which was not always easy, but which has instilled in me a belief in the value of being an artist as a calling far deeper and more important than its common hobby-status suggests. And with this belief came a realisation that this was my work in life - something I couldn't not do - as well as a determination that I would find a way to do it through creativity, perseverance, invention and sheer passionate commitment to the power and importance of art and story to human wholeness. My artist self stands here considering the gifts and complexities of the coming years, wondering how I will continue to birth art in this deep mothering time. I know that in order for me to hold my children in one hand and my paintings in the other, sacrificing attention to neither, I will need more support. Since my childrens's births I have thought often about the community living that we have lost and which could change so much. My proposal is this: perhaps  you , dear comrade in art and story, could be part of my community support? Perhaps you could stand in the hallway, cheering me on as I paint, providing financial support that will mean I am not stretched so thin, and the hours gained can be used to create art instead of running to stand still. How will I spend the money? First of all I will be able to continue to rent a studio. A monthly income from Patreon would cover the basic rent for my space which means I can dedicate my time to making art with no distractions, it is a place I go to paint, and leave the windows to the otherworlds standing open, and the oil paints lying about. A dedicated studio space away from home means that the art I create is more abundant and focused. This is the foundation of all the following dream-works, and the thing from which they spring.  Secondly I could begin to think about work which isn't immediately money-earning, ideas for paintings and projects which have simmered on my mind's stove for ages, waiting for that elusive moment when there's enough spare time and money to be able to focus on them. With small children in my life these projects feel even further away. Some of these ideas are as follows: To finish a long-ago-begun book , written and illustrated by me, and set in the folkloric, and umber-stained worlds of my imagination, and then to publish it and offer it for sale! To create a tarot deck . I have wanted to create my own tarot deck for many years, but the delicious task of creating 78 unique and potent pieces of magical art means many many hours of unpaid work. To make more animations . I have really loved the small amount of stop-motion animation I have done in the past, bringing my artwork to life at 24 frames per second, accompanied by music. This is painstakingly slow work of course, so always gets moved to the back burner in favour of earnings. To create a graphic novel.  I am very drawn to the storytelling possibilities of this form of artbook, and how I could make my style of work fit the small filmic image format. To develop more workshops  and ways of sharing what I do with others  Without the pressure of earning money each time I put pen to paper, I could indulge much more readily in the imagery that just wants to come through. There are many more art-dreams inside me, but these ones are knocking loudest right now. I have sincere hope that by reaching out my hand to you, these creations might manifest before I am an old woman. The internet is a strange place - we are at once far apart yet inside each other's days, and this can be both wonderful and uncomfortable. I think that this Patreon model of building a community of support around artists could be one of the wonderful things to come out of our online world. Even in our always-on, 24/7, electronic, blue-lit, attention-death internet world, we can somehow still sense the value of real soul-work and can use the tools at our fingertips to make sure that continues to live and thrive and grow roots and feed people. I am also hopeful that taking this leap can go some way to proving that motherhood and artisthood are not incompatible if we have a strong tribe at our shoulders. Those of you who sign up to support me here will be able to share in my artistic progress as I grow these new wings. I have heard from many many people how they miss my blogging and my regular sharing of artworks and writing. With the support offered by you here - be it small or large,  whatever  you can offer is received with gratitude beyond words - I hope that this can be the place where I can keep chronicling my work and all that feeds it. I want to make a commitment to producing at least one artwork a month to begin with, and then as my little ones grow, this work can too.  As I navigate the seasonal, seen and unseen, mythic landscapes of my life, I'm still learning: determined, reeling, clambering and impassioned to \nbe the artist I have no choice but to be, in the world and for the \nworld.  Will you join me on this road? ~ photo above of a very pregnant me and my son  standing inside a Bronze Age hut circle on Dartmoor ~"},

I couldn't be more grateful for that. Here's what I do: This is a Monthly page: On a monthly campaign, patrons are charged automatically once per month. Once those pledges are processed, patrons will receive the monthly reward. so feel free to edit your pledge to your liking~! Thank you so much for your consideration~!

Please DO NOT EVER play or support if you are under the legal age in your country!!!!!! \n\t \n\tWhat's the story about?\n\t \n\t This game is a parody of the grimdark future. The Imperium is threatened by enemies. Inquisitors— agents dedicated to preserving Mankind are far from omnipotent. So they employ Acolytes to help them protect the Imperium. Player will take the role of a young female protagonist, an Acolyte in service to an inquisitor. She will be tasked to investigate the disappearance of several officials and other mysterious cases in the city which might be related to certain heretical cult, twisted mutants, and other abominations.  The game is guided by the Acolytes investigation to root out the enemies. As an Acolyte, It is her duty to protect Mankind from the enemies, with a gun or bombs if necessary. \n\tHowever, there are times that she will not conduct her investigation in a conventional manner, due to her lack of training and proper equipment. So, she will have to 'improvise' and to use whatever means necessary to achieve her goals. Should she fails, entire worlds itself may fall to endless suffering.\n\t \n\t \n\tDuring the game, you will choose the actions of this character, aking decisions based on your personality. Enjoy the adventure of solving perverted mysteries, traveling to new locales, interrogating suspects, and performing sexy diplomatic non-combat task.\n\t \n\t \n\t Start your investigation as an Acolyte of the Inquisition \n\t \n\t \n\t Make a decision and choose your own story path that match your true personality \n\t \n\t \n\tEarn money, spend it to acquire weapons and armor to help you win combat against nasty enemies \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t What kind of NSFW content will be in the game?\n\t \n\tThere game will contain adult illustrations and animations (traditional frame by frame)\n\t \n\t \n\tWhat kind of Fetishes will those NSFW content be?\n\t \n\tWhat is currently on the plan are :\n\t \n\tMasturbation\n\t \n\tLesbian\n\t \n\tGroup sex\n\t \n\tInterracial sex (with alien race)\n\t \n\tBlowjob \n\t \n\tCunnilingus\n\t \n\tVaginal\n\t \n\tAnal\n\t \n\tFutanari\n\t \n\tDomination\n\t \n\tBreastfeeding\n\t \n\t \n\tWith more possible fetishes to be added based on what can be gathered from comments of the patrons. Let Celeng know what you want to see in the game, and he will figure out a way to put it in the game. \n\t \n\t \n\t What fetishes are not planned? \n\tCeleng \n\t WILL NEVER  develop content for sexual fetishes that are illegal (e.g. the depiction of minors), against ToS of Patreon (e.g. incest), or that we do not like (e.g. urination). \n\t \n\t My Second Game \n\t \n \n \n\tMy second game is still in early development, it is called \n\t \"Dungeon Ravager\"  and it is a platformer game with pixel retro style.  This game will also be updated monthly  with additional story, more characters, more features based from the feedback and resource availability.  \n\t \n\tGame Overview:\n\t \n\tWhile Liriteh (The main player character) travels across the galaxy, she received a distress signal from an Imperial world. It turns out that the automatons on the planet has gone rogue, and have done nasty things to the female population of the planet for some unknown reason. Lirieth teleports down to the planet to see what's really going on and amidst the chaos, there is an opportunity to have fun in an equally nasty way where she and her race of dark eldars are known for throughout the galaxy. Watch the Youtube video clip \n\t here . \n\t \n\tIn the end, whether you just want to stay updated and play the games or want to participate in the game making process by voting for key decisions and leaving feedback, Celeng would be happy if you would choose to stay. \n\t \n\t \n\tHelp Celeng to continue creating \n\t MORE FREE games ,\n\t \n\tMany thanks and hope you enjoy!\n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n"},

I am your local ObeyMe! NSFW slinger; though I do dabble in other fandoms and will take requests for other characters from my patrons!  I have been drawing my entire life, but only started drawing humans these last two years.  I dove deep into the world of NSFW art, and haven’t turned back since! I am still new to human art, and trying my best to continue to learn and grow!  I try to keep things as inclusive as possible here. Meaning MC is usually drawn as a blank slate / gender neutral for your self inserts, MCs, headcannons, and whatever else you would like to interpret!  The income and support I receive online has made it possible for me to pay off some medical debt ( US healthcare...sigh ), pay for groceries and more! I cant thank all of you enough for the opportunities you have given me!  A little about me... I am a scorpio and my brithday is Halloween I love anything Medieval and fantasy ( swords, knights , dragons…)  My car is my personality - 1986 iroc Z  My favorite anime is Hunter x Hunter  ♥️Things will get kinky ♥️ If you are uncomfortable with NSFW work, this may not be the page for you! If you are under 18, this is NOT the page for you! I would like this place to be a kink safe and judgement free zone!  ♥️What You’ll Get ♥️ So you may be asking yourself what exactly will you be getting by becoming a Patron of mine! As of now ( and this is subject to change depending on demand ) there are  three tiers  you will have access to become patrons of. Depending on the tier, you may just be supporting me as an artist or friend, or be gaining access to everything I have to offer! Please check more out on my page to see if any of the tiers interest you. To get access to all my NSFW, you must be in the Lucifer tier or above!  Thank You!  Lastly, I would like to say a BIG thank you! Support comes in many forms. Liking my content, commenting or sharing my work, or just letting me know you like what I do is more than I could ask for. If you’re considering becoming  a Patron, I appreciate your kindness and willingness to support an internet local artist! 💞"},

They aren’t finished and probably never will be, but I post them here when I’m too shy to post them publicly •   .CLIP and .PSD files:  These are the original files that I draw on for Patrons to download and look at if they want to dissect my drawing process or just mess around with my drawing layers. “.CLIPs” are compatible with Clip Studio Paint, and “.PSDs” are compatible with Photoshop I tag everything I post, so if you want to see specific things like all the WIPs, look through the “#wip” hashtag. Or for ALTs the “#alts” hashtag. Or for sketches “#sketch”, and “.clip” and “.psd” for the files, etc. Is there a Discord server? Yes! Patreon sends you the invite link when you join, but it can be easy to miss. If this happens, check your email as they usually send you an invite there too. If that didn’t work either though, then please DM me on Patreon and I’ll send you a direct invite link!"},

My typical posting speed has been 2-3 drawings a month I also apologies in advance since my English isnt the best there is totally gonna be typos in my comics and other posts.

You can find info on my Patreon content and stay updated on running projects on this Post. To navigate quickly through all my projects you can use the \n Index Page .  \n \n \n \n \nCreating these images is a great hobby of mine and I've been publishing my work for free on my \n Priapus Blog  for many years. I am able to do this thanks to the very generous support of many Patreon patrons! That is really wonderful and your pledge will make it possible for my heroes to continue their exciting priapic adventures, discovering new worlds and exploring new sensations. \n \n \n \nIn general, each project consists of four Reward Tiers: Wallpaper, WorkDoc, Gallery, and Add-Ons. The Gallery is the main section of a project, containing the story in a series of images. You can find background information on a project in the WorkDoc section, additional large-size renders, short series, GIFs, and/or animations are available in the Add-Ons section. So, the higher your monthly pledge, the more you’ll get to know about a project. Each Tier gives access to all projects.  \n \n \n \n\t $1     Wallpaper   - A monthly single large render \n\t $5    WorkDoc    - Background information on the project \n\t $10    Gallery      - Exciting adventure in a series of images \n\t $20    Add-Ons   - Extra-large renders, series, GIFs, and/or short  animations \n \n \nThe original size of the images is 2000x1000/1500 pix and a file with the entire series can be downloaded at the bottom of each post. Billing schedule   - Patrons are charged on the day they join, and then monthly on that same date. For example, if a patron joins on the 10th, they’ll be charged on that day, and then monthly on the 10th.  \n \n Updates -  A single Wallpaper on a running project is posted at the beginning of each month. The Gallery and Add-Ons are updated  once a week  on Sundays, and you'll be notified when new material is posted. The WorkDoc is normally posted at the end of the project. On average a project runs ca. 4 to 6 weeks. Due to the very slow process, an animation takes considerably longer to complete. \n \n To navigate  through all my projects, you can use the overview of this   Index Page  and the TAGS and filters on the  Posts Page.  A summary of recent updates and all   animations  is available here on this  Home Page .  Links are also added at the bottom of each post to direct you to the related tiers of the same project. \n \nNote that short sections of my projects are published on my  \n Priapus Blog. \n \n \n Next updates : 20 Nov 2022 - Starting a new project \n \n THE GARDEN OF EDEN  -  Completing Updated : 13 Nov 2022 \n \nAfter finding The Forbidden Fruit, our team continues exploring the outer regions of planet Tellus.

Patreon starts billing on the 1st of every month and continues until the 5th of the month. All payments made are for the current month. This means that if you pledge on the final day of January then that payment still only applies to January. You will still be charged again on the 1st of February for that month.

I also draw a lot of lewd pictures! \n \nCurrently, I'm working as a web developer as my day job and it kind of sucks. \n A lot . This is where you come in!\nI wanna see how feasible it would be to support myself with my art. At the very least, it can help cover some monthly expenses! \n \n \nI do want to make one thing clear though...\n \n \n I will never make you pay to see my art. \n \n \nMaintaining premium content on the internet in \n 2016  the modern day is a joke. I'm just sharing with you what I like to do, and in turn I believe you should be able to share that with others (as long as it's still free!). With the exception of project work under NDA, you will always be able to see what I draw for free. I will instead be offering bonus materials such as sketches, process images, or commentaries.\n \n \nBottom line is, this is a way for you to show your support for me, and in turn I can give you a little something as thanks!\n \n \n \nPlease note there  will  be porn, so  18+ patrons only  please! \n \n \n\t \n \n \nTo see more of my work, find me around the web at \n ricegnat.moe ."},

I love to draw anthro art -specially pinups and tasteful erotic art involving fully grown adult characters (18+) of all genders- as I try new techniques to develop my artistic skills and learn new things that will have a positive impact on my creativity. \n Why am I doing this Patreon?\n \nI really enjoy working on commissions, which is my main way to provide my living and food... but I'm getting less and less time to work on personal art and comics, which is how I expand my artistic horizons to improve my style and get faster at creating. \n \n \nComics are really, really time consuming, which means that I can't work on commissions, draw free comic pages and take care of other obligations at the same time without the risk of ending up in red numbers at the end of the month. Drawing stuff takes a lot of time and I want to dedicate more time and effort to my comics or other artistic projects without feeling forced to rush the entire process due to financial issues, which affects both the art quality and storytelling.\n \n \n \nWhy should I support you, Xpray?\n \n I don't consider Patreon a tipjar, but a good way to reward people who really want to support their favorite artists and the work they do, so I want to give something -equally good- back to all those who feel like supporting me and my work. Goodies! \n \n \n My Patrons will receive exclusive sketches, concepts and works in progress, as well as early access and hi-resolution (and sometimes wallpapers) versions of everything I draw, all finished illustrations and comic pages. They'll also be able to provide feedback and participate in polls to help with decisions for picture themes or comic progression.\n \nI'm planning to include more rewards soon, like: tutorials, slots for small cameos in comics/games and more. Suggestions for \nother future rewards are always welcome!\n\t \n\n Sounds good! What projects do you have in  mind?   \n Besides personal art? Quite a lot! First of all, I want to continue my free comic \"Last Survivor\" and bring the story to an end. It'll be a 20+ pages adult comic featuring  my characters Bukka and Vodka in their last, desperate search for a way to restore the situation in their planet after a massive alien invasion they were involved in. \n \n \nAfter that, I have plans for more free comics, animations and maybe a few games if everything goes well. One of the games would be an old-school RPG under the name \"Utopia Project\" -slightly connected to the events that take place in my comic \"Last Survivor\"- and the others would be visual novel/dating sims and interactive animations.  \n \n \n[\n COMICS AND OTHER ONGOING PROJECTS  ] \n \n Last Survivor: Final Episode\n (\"Choose your own adventure\" Flash Game, Comic and Visual Novel Hybryd - Ongoing) Last Survivor: Episode III \n (Complete - Included in the montly art packs) \n \n Breeding Pact  (Complete) Lady Xpray: Livestream of Pleasure  (Complete) \n [ GAMES ] \n \nVisual novel / Dating sim (Early WIP)\n \n \n \n Utopia Project  (Old-school RPG - Early WIP) \n \n \n \n \n \n Important! You must be 18 or older to pledge. Extra rewards like \nsome Alt versions, Wallpapers, Calendars, .PSD files and WIP videos will\n be sent via PM once the pledges for that month have been processed! I \ndo that to avoid \"pledge and run\" fake pledges and respect loyal patrons who kindly decide to support me (which is something I dearly appreciate). Additionaly, I also send old/missed art packs on a 1:1 ratio (one month missed to one month pledged). If your pledge got processed and you want a missed month's art pack, please don't hesitate to send me a message. Thank you so much for your support!\n \nIf you have suggestions or ideas, please don't hesitate to let me know!\nI'm still new to this, so I'll do my best to find new ways to improve my Patreon.\n"},

Previous to this, as a team, we had all been working in the UK nude photographic industry, such as Maxim & FHM, since the 90's and were seeing our industry being rapidly eroded by the internets influence. So we decided to launch an art nude site as an alternative to the harder imagery readily available online. We launched May Contain Girl in 2016 as a members only website, and it was an instant hit, however due to various issues, technical and financial, the site just could not survive. So rather than see it disappear we have decided to re-launch it on Patreon to see if this could make it viable. So we hope you will join us and support us on this new venture so that we can all continue to enjoy great nude art. Thanks Team MCG"},

There is no point talking about it, you already know it.  \t\t \t\tAfter a while, we've begun to work hard, and now we can bring our project to your attention. \t\t \t\t If you have any questions, suggestions, or good ideas, join the chat \t\t If you want to support us, but for some reason you cannot use Patreon, you can find us on boosty. \t\t List of my projects: \t\t \t\t1. Futa Quest. For some time now, things were going really bad for a young teacher Roxy. All because of her bad reputation. Being a futanari with a strong libido, she liked to take off the sexual tension using her young female students, but one day it all came out sideways when she had sex with the director's daughter. After that, all she could do is pack her things and get away from there before it was too late. But after a while by the greatest piece of good luck, she suddenly got a call from an elite agency and she was offered a specific job. Ah, if you only knew how happy she was when she found out she would work at the private camp for girls from very rich and powerful families. Her goal is to get the girls ready for adulthood and sexuality and to make the three richest girls pregnant with her child. What could be easier than this wonderful task? As it turns out, there are internal rules of the camp that will greatly complicate her life and make the task not that simple. part II  VERSION 1.45 This part of the game does not include files from the first part! If you for some reason didn't play the previous part, it's better to start with it to fully understand the plot and motivation of the game characters. part I  VERSION 0.65  ANDROID part II  VERSION 1.45 part I  VERSION 0.65 2. Futa in the Police Academy.  (on hold) This is a story about Sasha. She decided, at all costs, to apply to the Police Academy but she has a problem: she's not an ordinary girl.  Version 0.3 2. The Shop of Horrors Cadet Sasha appears in a very special place where she has to pass sexual trials to achieve her goal in the end. Version 1.0"},

I'm currently putting my skills to work on projects related to video game mods (specifically,  Breath of The Wild ) I began studying \"how to mod\" for Breath of The Wild around early 2020, finally completing and releasing my first mod that same year.  Why start a Patreon? Creating mods is fun but it's also challenging and requires alot of time, memorization and effort. My goal  is to turn this project into something much larger, possibly expanding out into multiple opportunities. Unfortunately, my ambitions take alot more time than I currently have. With your help, I can finally turn my passion into a full time career.

Each month I post a bulk splash displaying all (or most of) the works I created that month.  These include my own endeavors, commissions, as well as poll results.  Monthly posts go up on the last day of the month, and the polls rollover to the next round.  Nominations are always open, the polls themselves are usually open for a week or two. \n \n\t \n\t Early access items can be found in the  Gallery .  To unlock them, simply connect with your Patreon account via the toolbar to the left of the Gallery itself or the button in the upper right navigation bar on any page.  Once connected, the Early Access items will display as regular items do.  Each tier has access to the Early Access items for the tiers below it. \n\tItems may sit in Early Access for short or long amounts of time.\n\t \n \n\t \n\t Before the Gallery was in place, all rewards were kept on the  Rewards  page.  However with Source Files directly attached to their items in the Gallery, the Rewards page is mainly just used for the Stream archive now.  Previous reward packs are still kept in archival on the page, however. For convenience, if you're in the same tier as the  Early Access  rewards, there are also links to the folder containing all the source files for that month. \n \n\t \n\t The  Nomination  page allows Patreons to nominate content they would like to see in the polls.  This allows Patreons to influence what I make each month, and nominations are always open.  Tier-specific polls are listed on their reward categories. \n \n\t \n\t Old Source Files can be found in archival on the Rewards page.  Source Files created since October 2017 can be found attached to their respective items in the Gallery. \n\tAdditionally if you are of the Early Access tier, I have placed monthly packs in the Rewards list for easier bulk downloading.\n\t \n \n \n\t Classic passwords have been retired.  To login and enable rewards, simply sign in via Patreon's API with any of the Patreon login buttons in the Gallery. \n \n\t♫ \n \nI'm a busy body, but maybe one day I can use this to tilt a little more time into my crafts.\n \n \nIn the future I hope to become more efficient at colors, animations and 3D work to the point where I can produce them more regularly.

So if these are the sorts of things you are interested in, please check my website or deviantart gallery: Dynamoob Digital Pinups DeviantArt Page So why am I on Patreon? As most digital artists can attest, this medium isn't always cheap to make. New content and software costs money, plain and simple. So this is for those who enjoy my work, wish to see more of it, and wish to support me in creating it. You can help me to purchase new content so you as fans and supporters can get the best out of my comics and stories. Also, your patronage will provide me the added freedom, meaning I will be able to increase my productivity and concentrate more time to creating new comics on a larger scale. I can devote more effort into more expansive stories and greater detailed illustrations. Now, isn't that what we all want to see? You can help me out as much or as little as you like. Even a pledge of $1 is enough to earn my gratitude."},

But even still, whatever is pledged here will help go towards making the work on my projects better, as well as allowing me to more easily get the assistance I could use to help speed up the rate of releases and updates. It'll help with my general spritework as well! Thanks for checking me out!"},

My name is Max, aka  Paroro (or, formerly pyromaniac)  and I've been drawing as a hobby since I was a kid, but it wasn't till recently that I started taking things more seriously and I'm currently trying to live 100% from my art. I've been doing this for a while now, through commissions and small projects, it's a lot of work and I love doing so, but it's also very risky too. I came to Patreon seeking a more solid base and support to continue doing what I love, it allows me to continue working on my own comic projects, characters and stories. That's what many people have told me over and over, that they want to see more from my own creations, instead of just commissions,... but I lack the time (or sometimes the energy) for that since I'm constantly busy trying to fulfill my work list. I'm really looking forward to this and I'd appreciate just every tiny bit of support I could get from you, after all, if I'm still drawing, it's because of the support and encouragement I've received over the years. So thanks a lot for being here, even if you're just a curious passerby! And if you pledge, THANK YOU : ), be welcome and hope you enjoy,  make sure to browse my past posts! About pledging, rewards and access to posts! The rewards according to each month's tiers, are mostly the access to  all  the files I'm  constantly  posting! : D What I mean by this, is, instead of submitting a big batch of files at the end of each month, I just have everything available here, INCLUDING pretty much every file and post from the past months!  This why the  first  charge is  upfront !  At the very moment of pledging, and from there on it'll be on the first days of each month. I don't charge extra for accessing old files, they're there for you to see them if you want!  I appreciate all kinds of support ! ♥♥♥"},

Remember to set a max pledge amount so you are not charged more than you expect.  You can set the amount so that you only pay for one post a month if you prefer monthly campaigns.  Hello. I am Changer, lead developer of the game Adventure High, an artist and writer. I am running this campaign so that I can continue to provide frequent game updates, art, and short stories for everyone to enjoy. Patreon is a sort of happy compromise between my mortal need for food, and my desire to not put my content behind a pay wall. This is a  per-post  campaign, which means that you only get charged when stuff is actually made. I feel that this leads to better inherent accountability over time as becoming lazy would immediately mean earning less. Characters featured in artwork should always be assumed to have consented to the scene and being controlled ahead of time, and just enjoy it. Remember to always get consent from your partner on what you will be doing before play.  Adventure High Adventure High takes place in a world where the sudden introduction of magic and monsters have made travel and infrastructure difficult to maintain. The school stands at the center of your town, inviting all who might sign up to learn how to master their magical gifts.  The main character has the gift of control, which gives them potent support and debilitating spells. Will you choose to follow the path of a pure and righteous hero, allow yourself a little temptation, or use your power to conquer the school? The themes of temptation and choice will be prevalent within the game. You will have the opportunity to talk to, and build relationships with a variety of unique characters; or use your powers selfishly instead. Paid posts related to the game will include actual game updates, and full screen splash images. Smaller items such as icons, small chat avatars, and backgrounds will not count as paid posts. I work together with a couple other artists to make Adventure High better than I could on my own. The other members of the team include: Caveman Doodles: Splash Images Marc Ledesma: Splash Images Hilent: Splash Images Cucu: Splash Images Insanerium: Monster Art (Currently Inactive) RokuMoku: Avatar Art Succuquest Succuquest is a project I am going to be working on soon. You play as Fawn, a succubus with a thing for Heroes. Your mission is to become a hero yourself to prove your worth and impress the other heroes of the world.  This game will be an action platformer, with a stronger focus on transformation as a means to unlock new abilities.  Chien Vietnam: Splash Images Cypress D: Character Sprites Mind Conquest Mind Conquest is a side project I am working on so that I have something to work on once Adventure High is finished. In it, you play as a would-be conqueror who has just suffered a crippling defeat at the hands of some of the world's heroes. At the last minute, however, a foolish Psychic looking to jump start her own career as an evil overlord attempts to steal your knowledge, resulting in you possessing her body. Now, the two of you will have to work together to build an empire, restore your body's health, and create a harem out of the world's leaders and heroes. The game plays as a resource management game, with a puzzle aspect where you can adjust your captive's attitudes before allowing them to join your army. Paid posts related to Conquest will include full version releases, and large images prominently featuring a character; they will not include smaller graphics such as interface icons, avatars, or backgrounds.  Spiral Clicker Spiral Clicker is another side project I am working on when I find myself between AH updates but with not enough art finished to work on Mind Conquest. In this game, you use a spiral powered by your clicks to captivate the attention and adoration of many beautiful women and unlock outfits and CGs for each of them. Paid posts related to Spiral Clicker will include full version releases, and large images prominently featuring a character. They will not include minor UI elements, icons, or backgrounds. Artwork I do a fair bit of drawing, and have been working on getting better constantly. I've made quite a bit of improvement over the last couple years and am hoping to continue to improve as I go.  Patrons get two artwork bonuses. The first is that every patron at the one dollar or higher level will have access to high resolution versions of my art. Usually these are about twice the size that I usually publish my art. The second is that patrons donating at certain levels will have access to special patron slots. Just send me a message here with your request and I can add you to the slot if it's open or to the queue if it's not.  Paid posts related to my artwork will be fully drawn, and colored pieces.  Writing You may have noticed that from time to time I include a short story on the side or under some of my drawings. These are often fairly short due to space limitations of being included on a picture. I do have story ideas that are too large to fit into the side of a picture though. Instead of just keeping them to myself, I've decided to start writing them out as short stories.  I will release these stories here a week before anywhere else, so If you find that you enjoy my writing, not only will your pledge get you my stories sooner, but they again will contribute to my being able to write more frequently.  Paid posts related to writing will be either independent short stories of any length, or if the post is a chapter of a larger story, usually around 2000 words.  In conclusion I've tried to match the milestone goals along with patron rewards so that you will not only be rewarded directly for your support, but so will everyone. The more support I have, the more time I will be able to dedicate to these projects, and bringing you new content.  Thank you all for your support. "},

I've been doing furry art and comics for a while now, and figured I might as well make a buck or two out of it.\n \n Q: What do I get for contributing? A:  Just look at the tier descriptions above. Basically, you get one week early access to the comic and other art that I regularly post on Furaffinity and Twitter. Pitch in a little more and there's more Patreon exclusive art and you get to vote on two drawpolls a month! Q: Does Patreon exclusive content get released on public eventually? A:  Yes, I'm not a fan of paywalling content indefinitely. The regular comic strips I post on Saturdays (and the occasional art I do for fun) get posted a week later, but the Full Mast content gets posted 2~3 months later. I think that's a healthy balance between rewarding people for supporting me while not holding my art hostage for everyone else. Q: I'm under 18 and I really want to see your content early. May I? A:  No. Go back to school and stop putting the income of adult creators at risk. Q: Ok. By the way, what happened to the commission tier? A:  Unfortunately commissions ate up too much of my time, and the first-come-first-serve nature of doing commissions on a Patreon tier meant I didn't really get to pick which commissions to do, so I didn't get much enjoyment out of doing about half of them on a given month. The tradeoff is that I do two drawpolls a month now so the Full Mast patreons get the same bang for their buck. Q: What about Minotaur Hotel? A:  Alright, some of you folks know me from my work on Minotaur Hotel-  this is in no way a Patreon for that project , which is non-commercial. But I'm not going to turn down your money if you decide to pitch in anyways! Might as well get some goodies out of it, right? Thank you in advance if you plan on becoming a patron, and if you don't, at least having made it this far! Follow my  Twitter  for updates!"},

I've decided to create this Patreon page now, to help support my latest and most ambitious project yet:  Terminal Desires . What is Terminal Desires? Terminal Desires  is an erotic, zombie themed, role playing game made with  RPG Maker MV . Set in a fictional version of Earth where incredibly skimpy outfits and huge proportions are the norm. Control police officer Tiffany Neil as she and her partner investigate a mysterious distress signal from the small, secluded town of 'Ashton Lake' and uncover the horrors within.  Explore the town, face fearsome enemies in combat, make important story defining decisions and sexual choices. Will she submit to her every desire? Or will she resist and uncover the shocking truth hidden deep within the town's walls? Her fate, along with the town's is yours to decide... There will be a number of fetishes, some optional, but the main \nfocus initially will be on huge endowments, monsters/creatures and impregnation. Plus more as interesting ideas that fit the theme are requested/suggested by patrons. Why Support this Game? Supporting the development of  Terminal Desires   not only means that I can make the game as lengthy and ambitious as I plan, but it gives patrons the unique opportunity to affect the direction of the game's features, scenes, enemies, characters and selection of fetishes. There will be many discussions and polls where patrons can provide feedback and help vote on which content they want to see in upcoming updates. Plus, patrons will get early access to new game updates months before they are released to the public.  Thank you for your interest and support! Search for my blog \"Jimjim's Renders\" for more. ~ Jim CURRENT PLANNED SCHEDULE: (These are simply rough estimates. New versions will be released as they are completed.) Present: v0.10 ALPHA #2 is currently available to test for all patrons . PLEASE NOTE:  The ALPHA contains only 7 new Debra scenes & no \nnew story compared to v0.09. Instead, its purpose is to test the \noverhauled game systems, gather player feedback & find bugs. ALPHA, \nBETA & pre v0.10 saves will not be compatible with v0.10's FULL \nRELEASE. December 2022: v0.10 ALPHA #3 will be the final pre-release build for this version & will release in December. Patrons from September, October or November will also be sent a download link when it releases. Though its focus is on gameplay/features/polish, I am aiming to include the following new scenes: \tBig Barney X Debra \tTiffany X Vanessa \tTerry X Hitomi \tTiffany X Male Zombie (Gl*ry Hole - Day 3) Tiffany X Toy February 2023: v0.10 Full Release This has been a huge overhaul update that has taken the last 2 years to complete. A new save file will be required. The story will not progress beyond the Prologue(v0.09). But many new scenes & gameplay features have been added & improved upon compared to v0.09. Post v0.10: Finally getting back to a new version every 1-3 months, only focusing on new story, scenes and expanding the existing content. Meanwhile, supporters will discuss and vote on upcoming scenes/features/character designs for v0.11+."},

I'm a furry artist creating adult themed art. If you're a fan of  cute and sexy  characters like me, you'll enjoy a lot of my image sets and creations here. I like to focus on quality over quantity, trying that every piece be something unique, not manufactured. I enjoy making art and do it for the love of it! Sadly making them is a very time-consuming task and without support I wouldn't be able to do it at all. I live from this thanks to fans help, from one-time donations to people subscribing monthly. I sincerely  thank all my supporters for this <3  The patron role is very important since you'll be funding all my new artwork. You can be anonymous and just enjoy the content or if you want you will be able to participate on the process, give feedback and vote for new ideas. You'll also get special drawings and edits exclusive for my supporters. / ancesra ---- Quick FAQs if you want to learn  all the details: What my patrons get exactly?  By supporting  you're helping me create monthly : 4 to 12 full paintings (you get early access and voting powers). 1 big image set with 10– 20 edits (you get 1 year early access and special non-public edits). 20 to 30 rough drawings in a monthly art-pack (most are exclusives). 4 Behind the Scenes posts (can be painting progression videos, art journal with notes on some works, technical studies or other content). In resume, you will receive at least more than 70 images/edits per month on this Patreon (plus 3 years worth of past content). I work on this full time making at least 2 post/updates weekly. How are the rewards mechanics handled?:  I give three types of rewards to all patrons as a thank you token for your support: immediate, monthly and tokens.  1. Immediate:  If you pledge you will gain immediate access to all posts and my finished images (from all time);  2. Monthly:  A compilation folder will be shared privately via Patreon the last week of each month tentatively;  3. Token:  For every $25 you had pledged I will give a \"imaginary\" ticket that you can change for optional special rewards, like past folders. You need to contact me to exchange these tickets. What do I draw?:  I like to draw a wide variation of furry characters and themes. You can visit any of my public galleries on links below to get a better idea if you don't have already.

Want to see samples of my art and animation? Check out my twitter full of my free content:  Twitter NOTE:  Pay up front is enabled so you will be charged on the day you signup and then again on the 1st day of every month. WEEKLY UPDATES Every week you can expect regular updates with new pages of comics and pinups. DARKLORD UNIVERSE GAME I am also developing an interactive erotic game that will unite all Darklord content and comics. It's still very early in development, but I will update my progress at least once a month. Bishop tier gets early access to new work-in-progress builds.

For pages 1-431  you can find them at  johnpersons.com  - sorry, but I cannot post them on this patreon.  Johnpersons also has all of the Exclusive Interview comic and all content I did there, before I started using Patreon in 2017. There are so many ideas and years worth of content I want to develop, but I can't do it without your help to create more epic stories, more fantastic babes, more dominating males, more drama, more passion.  Patreon is the best way to communicate and collaborate with those who share the same ideas and enjoy the same types of stories. With your patronage you can help direct the stories through voting and together we will create new exciting stories. I am starting to create new interactive entertainment games and applications using Unity and Bishop level patrons will get access to see my work-in-progress builds. Once those builds are tested and fixed they will be available to the lower tiers.  Plus your support will help allow me to spend more time creating art and interactive media. Thank you! Aside from the rewards at each tier, every single patron also gets my heartfelt gratitude as I know there are thousands of artists and so much variety out there. If you choose to support me that means you value not just my art, but also the community and rewards that patronage provides. "},

In the mist of the chaos, a man decided to send his only daughter,  Nadya , to a far away Monastery to keep her safe.  11 years later, the Kingdom was safe once again, and  Nadya  decided to leave the Monastery and go on a journey back home. There, the edifications were mostly rebuilt, but the aftermath of the invasion left the townsfolk decimated, and the Village habited mostly by lonely men.

You are also helping me to create financial security so that I can provide for my two children.  This revenue is the bulk of my income, as a creator. It is honestly THE BIGGEST help to me as a single mom right now to have your support and I want to honor that connection within this space by creating as much exclusive content and opportunities for interaction and engagement as possible.  I want to be intentional about the content in this space and the chances we have to come together virtually as a community.  I want everyone in this space to feel safe, to feel seen and heard, but most of all to actually feel connected to everyone else and not only to me. I want for people in this space to have access to the resources that are fueling my reprogramming and de-colonization. I want for you all to also have a chance to get to know me better as an artist, creative, and as a comprehensive and complicated human being behind the content you love to consume.  I want to be intentional about having moments of softness that are so quiet they leave you broken and curious in ways that louder moments couldn't.   Patreon is exactly how you make sure that I am able to afford maintaining free content.  It is a priority that I keep a sustainable collection of free work and resources available to those who cannot afford a subscription to this space.  You are paying it forward and redistributing wealth by showing up here to support the content I create.   While all my main content is and shall remain free and easy to access, you will find more here.   I want to create a sense of curiosity and a sense of urgency around the concept of making mistakes and making amends.  This is the place to fuck it all up, apologize, course correct, and rebuild.  This is how we heal. I hope you agree that the world we are all working together here to create for the future can only be done when we are intentional and aware of our healing.  So let's ask the hard questions, stumble onto answers, and grow together in this space with the resources I provide and the interactions we can share as a community. Your trust and engagement is Everything to me, literally the air that I breathe!  I'm infinitely humbled by your support and interactions!  "},

My Patreon reward list is content I've made within that month.  I will make  at least 4 artworks with painting video and raw file , and a few custom brushes for each month. There are some more extra drawings without video process recorded every month too.  P.S.  I will still keep uploading my brushes for free in the future , like two or three years after they are released on my Patreon. So supporters who are in the tier with brushes reward included will get to use my brushes before other people every month. "},

I’m Koriandr, creator of web comic  Im|mortal . Im|mortal is a webcomic inspired by Russian folk tales about Koschey the Immortal and Ivan Tsarevich (Prince Ivan). One day I was thinking about the meaning of a Russian saying “Koschey o’er his gold withers”. What if the “gold” – something Koschey treasured – did not mean the riches? What if it was a person? Someone with golden hair… like Ivan’s. Why is Ivan Tsarevich always the one to triumph over Koschey, the main villain of many tales, even though Ivan himself may not be that special? And that’s how I got the idea of this story – a story about love that was born against all odds. The comic is updated twice a week. The uncensored version is only available here on Patreon. You will also have access to new art, sketches, additional materials, speedpaint videos and other content. Enjoy! "},

You've seen my twisted faerie tales. You've seen my art. You've read my comics. You know I've been making art for over 15 years. You know I've been creating comics for most of that time. You've probably watched me grow as an artist, from the very early days of  Comedity , through the stellar work I did on  Star Power . You know the caliber of work I put out.  So, you know who I am, you know what I do. So... why am I here? Shouldn't I be drawing comics or something? You're exactly right. I should be drawing comics or something. I WANT to be drawing comics or something. I have so many ideas to explore and so many things I want to draw, but if there's one thing I've learned in the last 15 years of making comics or something, it's that it's damn hard to be creative and prolific without a stable financial base. Projects languish or are abandoned every day because creators can't afford the time to dedicate to them. Which is where this Patreon comes in. Having concluded my last major comic project with Star Power, I'm now moving on to new comic endeavors. The biggest of which is called Witch & Wane, a SFW high fantasy comic about a world-weary witch hunter who unexpectedly finds herself the guardian of a troubled young witch whose budding powers threaten to consume him and everyone around him. It's a big graphic novel-type story that I'm super stoked to be developing.  I'm also working on a number of shorter, if distinctly NSFW, including some adventures though Wonderland and the quest of a Paladin of Love to conquer the demons of Lust. Adult stuff is fun, and I'm really quite good at it. Not interested? No problem, I've set tiers to handily section the adult content away from the less naughty stuff. Ultimately, this will be a platform from which all my new projects will spring. And you will have a front row seat for it all: the gritty development work and behind the scenes sketches, as well as early access to content and comics. The more you all pledge, the more I'll get to focus on original content. Come, join me. Admission is cheap, and it promises to be quite the show."},

Here I've pledged to the Supporter tier or higher, how do i make a suggestion for polls? You can share your ideas with me on the Discord server linked some lines up here on the various patreon suggestion channels, alternatively you can comment under the Masterposts here on this website (check \"drop suggestions here\" in the featured tags down below) or you contact me privately via DMs. There is no hard limit to how many suggestions you can make so don't be shy! I've pledged to the Ally tier, how does the reward work?   Your reward consists on either a monthly sketch or a (cumulable) 20% discount on a future commission. If you want the sketch just contact me on Discord or here on Patreon! If you don't contact me during the month you will automatically be given the discount. Sketch complexity is flexible, but generally it will consist in one full body sketch with rough grayscale shading or something of equal value. As for the commission side, the 20% discount can stack, meaning you get a free commission after 5 months! In order to prevent overworking, these commissions are limited to single fullbodies (extras can be charged separately) and most importantly, the discount stops stacking after 100% and until delivery, meaning you can't ask for 2 free comms after 10 months. The discount resets after delivery. Remember, this is a reward and not a paid service, you pledge to support my art, I take full liberty of cancelling and refusing commissions."},

I love what the furry community has brought to my life and I'm passionate about striving to improve and diversify my skills to I can provide quality content for those around me. I work full time as a freelance furry artist to support myself through my second degree in medical lab science. Most of my content will be big men, girly boys, cute chubbos, trans girls, and transformation.  Why Patreon? I would like to start providing my own original content and merchandise for the fandom to enjoy, however my work schedule is constantly tied up with custom commissions for individuals. While I do greatly enjoy making custom work for people and do everything I can to satisfy them, I would love to also provide more content that has more personal passion and investment as I believe that's where people's best work stems from.  Why Become a Patron? Every extra bit of financial earnings I receive here allows me to dedicate more work time towards those personal projects. To quantify this, I've set up goals giving some details as to what kind of work I'll be able to provide based on the gracious donations of you patrons. Some of my ultimate goals are to provide comic series and small animations with the kind of subject matter that my supporters have come to know and love.  By becoming a patron you'll gain access to an ever increasing number of rewards as you look higher in the tiers. Starting from early access to high resolution images as a thank you for small donations, to PSD files that give artists a view behind the scenes of how I work, to rewards that my potential commissioners would benefit greatly from such as private streams and locked commission slots. Each reward is a thanks I can give for allowing me to provide my passion projects to the community.

First, I'd like to thank everyone who has supported me in ANY way shape or form, not just financially. It means a lot to have been told my work is great and that people love what I do and that they are totally here for me and my content. Hearing those kinds of things can make any creator feel great and be able to keep going. So thank you for that. Now on to the news!  My patreon is going to go backwards quite a bit. This may be disappointing to some, I know, and I'm really sorry if I have disappointed any of you because of this change.  I have to go back and revert my Patreon to a simple \"support/tip jar\" kind of deal. The reason for that is because I'm starting some zbrush/3D work courses/schooling and when I finish these classes, I'll most likely be going to a school in LA . This is a HUGE deal to me and it's a BIG step in a direction I've always steered away from out of fear of not being good enough. It's going to need a lot of my time and dedication and if I want to be successful at it  quickly , I need to concentrate and  live it . Unfortunately, I cannot focus on school, real life events and keep up with Patreon content all at the same time. I wish I was a power house of a person who can do EVERYTHING. Trust me, those people exist and they are amazing and I envy them! But thats just not me. I take medications that exhausts me at times and it's a job to even stay awake on the 'bad days'. I've dabbled in 3D work before. And I've always felt a sort of calling to the craft. I feel really at home when I work in 3D. I wish I would have perused it in the past but I can't look back now. All I can do is act and that's what I'm doing. My heart is totally into this, guys. I want to create amazing things for myself and for everyone. I want to create figures and content that's hardly touched on in 3D. I even want to do character concepts, etc. I just feel like my work and what's in my head translates better via 3D modeling than anything I could do 2D. And I want to at least TRY to master it and get something out of this feeling. I have to give it a shot even if that means sacrificing a great deal of money and time. I've had numerous  professional  3D artists who've worked on games and in the industry reach out and tell me \"You're so good for being so new!\" along with many other uplifting conversations recently that it has ignited the urge to do more in 3D and hey, who knows, maybe this is where I should be. So, I hope everyone understands why I'm making this change. I have to at least try. Even if I fail or give up and continue doing what I know I  can  do- at least I TRIED.  And lastly, my Patreon isnt going to be completely dry. I will still post things here off and on. Maybe even 3D stuff. But it'll be when I can and what I choose. It'll all still be very exclusive to Patrons only. So, no worries there. These changes are effective as of NOW. I wanted to announce this before anymore charges can be made. Please feel free to retract your pledge if you wish, or stay!  Thank you all so much for sticking with me, encouraging me, keeping me busy and helping me enjoy creating art. I truly, SINCERELY, appreciate it. Please know that. I don't like to delve deep down into my personal life/issues and make them known to everyone, because I mean... who DOESNT have problems, right? And I never want to add to anybodies hard times. But just know that the people who enjoy my work, who chat with me, comment at me, support me in anyway have helped me through the toughest times (and most dont even know it). So, thank you for that.  I hope you're all not too disappointed and even if you are, I still love ya, and I understand. I'll still be posting doodles and shitposts via twitter, so I wont be TOTALLY gone while I'm studying. Thank you all again. It's really hard for me to close something like this, cause idk where to stop! Ugh! I'm so nervous!   Well, thank you all so much for your attention and time. I appreciate you all <3 \""},

I’m Andy I'm a 28-year old Brazilian digital artist! I have been drawing digitally since over ten years ago, but decided to make a living out of it when I went to fine arts school. After graduating in 2017 I came back to creating in fandom spaces and realized I have a passion for it. I want to keep on making fanarts, and Patreon has been helping me do it. WHY PATREON Living as an artist in a country going through an economical and social crisis is not easy, and Patreon is an amazing platform which allows me to continue growing, while being able to work more freely and experimenting with personal fandom projects. The financial help from you all as Patrons is what allows me to keep creating what I love ♥ REWARDS Every personal project of mine (be it sketches, tutorials, or fully polished paintings) will be posted here first! That way, Patrons will not only get an exclusive and early access to all my art, but also to a more close-knit space, in which I’ll share processes, insights, and all things I not always share on social media. VOYEUR and ENABLER tiers also get access to all my NSFW art, which is exclusive here on Patreon. ♥ THANK YOU! This is all possible thanks to your support! I am aware that not everyone can afford a pledge, but if you’d like to help, a like or retweet goes a long way! All the love and support I’ve gotten in these last couple years is what has gotten me so far. And to everyone that has helped or is helping me financially either through Patreon or through commissions, you have all my love and gratitude. ♥ email  //  twitter  //  instagram"},

I especially love painting fan art of some of my favorite characters from games, movies, and anime.  \n \n Why Patreon? I wanna try to create a stronger relationship with my supporters, by giving them a chance to become more involved in my creative process. I also want to ignite myself to improve my drawing skills and explore my artistic potential. With your support, you can help me create more and better content! <3 \n \n How does Patreon work? \n Patreon allows you to support your favorite creators, and in exchange, you will receive cool rewards from the creator every month. Depending on the reward tier you choose, a patron can receive additional rewards. \n \n When will I receive my rewards? All rewards created during the current month will be sent out the following month between the 4th-5th when Patreon has successfully processed your pledge.  For example, if you joined to get a reward announced in January, you'll get your rewards in the first week of February. After you are successfully pledged, you will not be charged until the beginning of next month (during the first week of every month). You don't instantly gain access to the rewards you signed up for until this monthly package is completed and then you'll receive a link from me, containing your rewards.

That’s why I’m striving to improve more and more so that I can offer you the best I can. I finished a major in culinary and started working at the age of 19 until i was 21 when I finally became a head chef. During my day off’s i always draw the whole day. And the day finally came  that I decided to quit my job because my mental health cannot take the toxic environment of my workplace. Call it a gamble but I quit my job with a few dollar on my savings to focus on art and creating webcomics for contests. It was really a struggle at first. but now here I am.

My name is Wylie Beckert, and I'm the lone paintbrush behind  Reign of Sin and Rule of Virtue  - a series of hand-painted playing card illustrations inspired by the deadly sins and heavenly virtues.  My playing card projects are creator-owned, one-woman efforts made possible entirely by the continuing support of my amazing patrons! Thank you for joining me on this journey through strange (and often dangerous) lands... (Finished card art for Pride: the King of Clubs) WHAT I'M DOING I'm making the art that I'm crazy about: insanely detailed pencil and ink paintings that offer a window into a sinister yet inviting fantasy world. My current project is my most ambitious yet: a pair of two painstakingly illustrated card decks, one dark and one light, featuring full-body, dual-identity royals entangled in sinful and virtuous dealings. (Early playing card concepts: Kings of Pride and Humility) Despite my love of illustration, this project is about more than just the art: I'm also weaving a narrative for the decks through character backstories, framed as glimpses of an ever-shifting future according to the conflicting visions of two rival prophets. WHAT YOU'RE MAKING POSSIBLE Because I make my living through freelancing, passion projects often get sidelined in favor of the more workaday assignments that pay the bills. Your support will offer the freedom to focus more time on creative ventures like Reign of Sin - the type of projects that I'm the most excited to work on, and that followers of my art are the most excited to see. (Process tutorials document my ever-changing traditional media process.) My painting process is an ever-evolving adventure in traditional media. One of the reasons I love Patreon is that, unlike commercial clients, my patrons give me free rein to venture into new territory, make mistakes, and create beautiful things in line with my own vision. Sharing the things I learn along the way is my way of saying thank you! (From the tutorials: pencil drawing in progress...) In addition to creating new & awesome artwork, I like to provide artists (and art enthusiasts) with some insight into my techniques and materials - documenting my working process from ideation to finish in text, photos, and (whenever possible) video. This additional content takes time to create; your support helps make process tutorials a regular feature of my work instead of an occasional bonus. (From the tutorials: ink painting in progress...) VISIONS FOR THE FUTURE My first card deck, Wicked Kingdom, was launched through Kickstarter in 2016. As soon as the artwork is finished, I'm hoping to do the same with Reign of Sin. Your support will help this happen sooner by allowing me to shift my focus from my commercial illustration clients towards my own strange, dark vision... (the first deck my supporters made possible, Wicked Kingdom! Buy it at  www.wyliebeckert.com/shop ). The complete Reign of Sin series will consist of two playing card decks - which means twenty-four face cards, eight aces, four jokers, two card backs, and a set of custom pips for the remaining numerical cards (along with package design once this bird is finally ready to fly). I'm expecting to create two paintings per month, but am hoping increased support through Patreon will allow me to raise the bar and, with any luck, finish the deck sometime in 2018. (Cards from the finished Wicked Kingdom deck. Reign of Sin will be even bigger and better!)   BECOMING A PATRON You can pledge any amount you choose; you'll get various rewards (listed at right) based on how much you pledge. Pledges will be collected for each finished painting, and payments will be processed around the 1st of the month. You can also set a cap for your total budget (so as not to break the bank if I'm especially prolific one month), and cancel any time if my artwork ceases to catch your fancy. NEW REWARD: MONTHLY POSTCARD PRINT CLUB! all patrons supporting at the $25 tier or higher will receive a five-print Welcome Pack their first month, plus a new Patreon-exclusive postcard print each month for the duration of their patronage."},

THRICE !  We made the normal mode with the male main character, a normal futa mode and the Jane mode, which we have a female main character! And we made a extra game,  BALI QUEST!  And in the future we might have a  Jane futa mode! Here are the numbers: -7 Characters(2 growth levels for each girl; Each level contais differents graphics, biceps flexing and FMG scenes) -2 acts -18 different endings. And a secret one! -A special section where you can see the events and graphics at your own leisure. Also, you can see extra arts made for the game. -And a lot of others things exclusive for each mode! I used flash to build the game which is pretty dead by now, but there is a lot of ways to execute the files. The easier one is playing the standalone files: Normal mode: https://www.dropbox.com/s/6y4nyi8aw7wrgoa/massattraction1_0_3_standalone.exe?dl=0 Futa mode: https://www.dropbox.com/s/yhi4hf12mapwwgd/massattraction_futa_1_0_3_standalone.exe?dl=0 Jane mode: https://www.dropbox.com/s/w9t64gzon98z9pu/MassAttraction_JANE_1_0.exe?dl=0 Or you can try the online versions, wait a bit to load: Normal mode: http://www.reddypics.com/game/ Futa mode: http://www.reddypics.com/futa/ Jane mode: http://www.reddypics.com/jane/ And don't forget Bali quest!: http://reddypics.com/quest/ And you what I am doing now?  A NEW GAME! It's called  MUSCLE FANTASY , a digital novel with RPG elements! Again, it will be a free game. The player must select a character and chase her destiny in a sexy and muscular way. I plan to include several playable characters with different ending and dificulty modes. you can see the progress through here: http://www.reddypics.com/fantasy/ If you choose to be my patron, You will have access to test versions, arts, sketchs, etc . Beyond  that, I am doing some side projects like  MUSCLE IDOL(+70 PAGES) , a picture gallery(+30 pictures so far!) and a lot of Fun stuff!

First, I don't know, I never visited a psychiatrist or a loony doctor. Like any person, I have bills to pay, replace computer parts, eat, do others stuff rather than drawing muscular girls for hours, etc. Think like this: You are helping me to make this experience the more confortable and enjoyable as possible. The work will proceed faster, I will be able to fill the games with more content, extra comics and arts. And of course, you will be a part of the production. Working alone is pretty sad!

It is based around a visual Novel system with bullet hell encounters and top down RPG elements. While there are many amazing text based games out there, I am but a monkey and enjoy pictures. For this game I aim to balance the story, with visuals and casual left or right layout game play. The game is being made on the Unity engine with support for Windows/Mac/Linux & mobile support coming later.\n \n \n \n \n\t Premise \n \nYou have been sent to explore planets by a company specializing in Adult Gene Modification. It is your task to find new species and research their features. You can obtain DNA samples from characters you like and bring them back to your base ship to test. You might even find natural means of modification. The characters you encounter in the world will include Humans, Fantasy races, Monsters & Furries with varying features and genders. For a progress overview you can check the timeline below.\n \n \n \n \n\t Links: \n\t Twitter \n\t \n \n \n \n\t Planned Demo Features \n\t R1 = working prototype R2 = fully featured R3 = Refined \n\t- Complete demo story arc | \n\t (in progress) \n\t- 1 landing location with 8+ sub areas | \n\t (R1 completed) \n\t- 40+ fully rigged live2d characters with physics | \n\t (14/40) \n\t- 1 companion character | \n\t (R1 completed) \n\t - Text based player character |  (in progress) \n\t- Custom Tile Map art with 2 movement types | \n\t (R1 completed) \n\t- Painted backgrounds for major/minor locations | \n\t (R1 completed) \n\t- Character viewer (Gallery) | \n\t (planned) \n\t- Bullet hell mini game (encounters & DNA) | \n\t (R1 completed) \n\t- Inventory system | \n\t (R1 completed) \n\t- RPG system | \n\t (in progress) \n \n \n\t \n\t \n\t Current team \n\t- Kurotama\n\t \n\t  \n\t \n \n \n\t Support \n \nThrough support I can transfer freelance hours over to this project and you can get some perks. I also want to make sure I'm prioritizing work on the game. It’s easy to get distracted, hence why things like discord chat access is paid. I enjoy chatting with yall, but opening up the chats publicly is just a bit much right now. For perks I’ll be doing monthly packs with some smaller content in between. Here’s a list of perks, with more to come:\n \n \n Mini Vtubers : Every month I’ll be making/upgrading a mini vtuber you can use! (public use) \n Game Assets:  1 Monthly game asset for usage in a live2d viewer & Vtube Studio (personal use) \n Wallpapers:  HSG themed wallpapers \n Polls:  Characters, Design & features \n Tutorials:  A tips series for live2d and maybe some art \n Discord:  All tiers get access to discord chats & patreon feed for the relevant tier. \n \n Private & Public usage details:   \nThese are subject to change per item, read the included usage txt file per item. \n Private:  Items under private usage (Game Assets) cannot be used to make money or streamed publicly. This is to prevent the possibility of a charter in-game being associated with the actions of someone using this model. The creator retains intellectual property rights. \n Public : These items can be used at the patrons discretion (Mini Vtuber). For streaming, role playing or for profit. \n \n \n Mini Vtuber  customizations : \nYou can get some customizations of the monthly mini vtuber depending on your tier. \n Hyper Flame tier:  Customization like colors or patterns. (est 30m max work) \n Hyper Space tier:  YCH customization such as ears, tails, colors. (est 1h max work) \n \n Current:  Jena Type I ( Info & TOS ) \n Previous:  Mini Flame \n \n\t !! Note !! \n \n- This should  not  be used to get a discounted full vtuber from me. Full vtubers take a lot of work, please consider looking at my  Carrd  for commission pricing. \n- The higher tiers also account for other perks and to supported my work. \n- You can chose a\n previous mini vtuber model for customization, however the current one is preferable.\n \n \nHyper Space tier Customization example: \n \n  \n \n \n\t Disclaimer \n\t Just like to note a few things here. \n\t- This is 18+ only content, all characters are 18+ \n- As mentioned above the game is currently not released yet.\n\t \n- While I enjoy making things like trailers and advertising content, \nit's just for fun and I hope it doesn't come across too brand-like.\n\t \n- This is the first large game I have made. I have quite a bit of \nexperience in areas around game dev, however, due to the scale of the \nproject I am bound to make some mistakes. Just make sure I learn from \nthem ;)\n\t \n- The base game will always be free <3\n\t \n \n \n Timeline \n \n \n Screenshots \n\n"},

Lineart commissions or any lineart-only works I do also count as finished works and are still going to be posted to my gallery. If anything doesn't show up in my gallery, it's because it's an extra reward, because either me or my client doesnt want me to post it, because I haven't officially posted it anywhere online, or because I will eventually post it later.  This Patreon is mainly for those who want to go the extra mile to provide some extra appreciation and support.  Also,  my goal is to make a living with my art and creativity alone , and I believe having a Patreon would be of tremendous help to do that. \n \n \"Ok, but can't you just open more commission slots?\" \n \nWell yes, but actually no. While I can draw and upload pictures reasonably fast, making each of them still takes me the entirety of anywhere from 2 to 5 days, and finding a good time window to do that can be tricky.  S imply  increasing the number of commissions would overload me . So,  I'm maintaining this Patreon page to pick up the slack from commissions , as while commissions alone are not as sustainable as I thought they'd be, I still love drawing them and would like to continue doing so at a more comfortable pace, so having a Patreon to back it up would at least allow me to afford more rest from time to time, yielding better quality art in the long run. \n \n \"Fair enough, but what do we get in return?\" \n \nOf course, I have thought in advance of doing many cool stuff for my patrons in return for supporting me. For example, I don't really upload any lineart or WIPs of my works to my gallery, so you might not know what I'm currently working on, but just by joining the lower tiers, you can now get  sneak peeks of my upcoming works , or  any lineart of my works . You'll also get  access to exclusive alts of my works . Higher tiers will also have access to  ultra high-res versions of my works  (this is a bonus, as my works are already done at a really high resolution and I will continue to do so). Also, one thing I've always wanted to do was to make pictures based on poll results from the community, and I never really had enough time for that because I need to keep doing commissions to stay alive, but now I can do that once enough people start joining even the cheapest tiers,  so this is your chance for having a go at choosing what I should draw next  or even being able to  suggest which characters appear on the poll  as well, with  higher tiers having more voting power . Now  all patrons get a discount for all future commissions  for as long as they support their tiers too. Also, that's just the beginning,  I will definitely add and/or upgrade existing tiers in the future.  I also now have a  patron-exclusive Discord server , so if you ever feel like chatting with me or fellow like-minded individuals, there's no better place than discord. The server is also boost level 3, so we have all the extra perks possible too. \n \ntl;dr: Basically, I've started my patreon as a complement to commissions, and once more patrons start joining, I will be able to do a lot more fun things with my art in addition to doing commissions at a comfortable pace,  and you get to join the fun as well .  \n Anyways, hope this clears any questions you might have. Have a great day!  As always, feel free to ask any more questions, especially if you need more information about the tiers."},

Why I Started Patreon Through the past 10 years, I've come to know that many from around the world have embraced my works, but there wasn't a very good venue to reach all of my overseas fans. In fact, providing NSFW comic books to other countries was a daunting task... But, now we have Patreon! I am looking forward to connecting with readers from around the world under my own flagship port on Patreon. I Need Your Support! All proceeds and support will be used to power the translations for my works. Also, part of your proceeds will help me continue my passion and endeavor as a comic artist (the recession in Japan has really taken a toll on life as a comic artist). With enough support, I may be able to hire assistants to help with my works to create more comics for everyone. Patrons Will Get... Supporters will have access to my official translated comics (for all my latest and greatest as well as my classics), newly created arts, WIP pics, sketches, and even PSDs! *Please note that some comics and arts in this Patreon are for NSFW(Adult Only).

A little bit about me:  I\nalways loved art but things weren’t always easy. So I decided to learn a lot in school and successfully passed my exams in university. After graduation I understood that I feel empty without art and changed  my life.  I started drawing seriously in 2014 and learned a lot. Now I have so many ideas for future arts and even for several of my own projects!  What I draw:   Fan art, original pieces and commissions. I love to try something new and to learn new techniques) All my works you can see here:  http://olchas.deviantart.com/ Why I am on Patreon:  This\nis my only chance to continue creating art. So I have a choice: -To forget about my dream, stop drawing and find another job. -With your help to continue creating paintings for you, improve and start my own projects! Also people often ask me which brushes and tricks I use while drawing. And here I’ll show you everything that usually stays behind the scenes. You will get: - All my works done during the month - High-resolution images  - Step-by-steps - Pin-up and 18+ images - Photoshop files and  - Brushes packs - New wallpapers each month - Video processes of the work When rewards are delivered  💌: When you pledge Patreon doesn't take you money, it starts charging only on 1st of the next month!! This process takes several days, so rewards are sent on  4-7th  of the next month! So  if you pledge in September, for ex., you subscribe for September, Patreon will start charging on October 1st and you'll get rewards during the first week of October.  This system is good for too reasons: 1. You can see all works of the month and decide if you like them. 2. You can change you pledge before Patreon will start charging! How to get previous months rewards: You can get past months rewards through: - Pledge $20 #2 (includes rewards $10 of 2 months: current and one any previous); - Pledge $30 (includes rewards $15 of 2 months) You can find summary previews of all previous months here  (all images are clickable): Past rewards list Remember that  all content is for personal use only.

Patreon is a great way for us, artists, to share our creations with the people who love what we do, and plus, would love to support our work. By becoming a patreon, you significantly help with the expenses and time that goes into creating animated art, while receiving additional content in return.  ⋮ ⋮ ⋮What kind of content do you Create? Short Animations -  Male muscle growth animations in b/w   Sketches -  Fictional-muscled characters from stories/stand alone (Line art) Colored Sketch Art  - A small library of colored fictional characters Gifs  - Short-moving images of muscle characters (GIF file) Voted-on content -  Polls, your input could play a part on future content ⋮ ⋮ ⋮How does this work? Basically,   newly-created original content will be released here first , some of it  might  later be released on to husskoni's other platforms.  Based on the level reward one pledge's (subscribes) into, you get to enjoy the different content (see rewards bar on right). This is a  charge-up front   site. Which means: The moment you pledge to a tier, your support will reach the creator and  you'll be granted access,   for that month , to the content-library you chose . If you  wish to continue supporting husskoni's creations  you'll be billed the 1st of every upcoming month after your 1st pledge.  Also  remember:  You can raise/lower tiers  or unpledge (unsubscribe) whenever you wish. ( If you'd like to take full-advantage of the tier-rewards in a month it is advised to pledge at the beginning of the selected month ) ⋮ ⋮ ⋮Content FAQ? Animations?   On Average, at least 1 muscle growth animation is created every 2 or 3 months . It will not necessarily be a story. The animation can be a short excerpt, a sequence, or be part of a continuous story.  Sketches/Line art?  Mainly depicts characters from current/past animations, current project snaps & exclusive sneak-peeks. Images are JPEG or PNG files. The vast majority is black & white but some are colored every once in a while.  Voted-on content?   Meaning that, patreons get to help decide if a story might continue, a certain theme of a new animation, look of a character~  It is also important to point-out that although it's fun to draw for others, creators are fulfilled entirely when they bring their own ideas into reality. That is the main purpose of the voted-on content: To complement a work in progress. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  \"Patreon-Exclusive Content\"  Will only be released here and no-where else!   ____________________________ THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST AND SUPPORT ________________________ Husskoni's Socials:   Youtube  -  Tumblr Blog  -  Instagram   -  Twitter Official Links • • • Disclaimer:  This site is meant for an adult audience.

In september of 2020 I've released my first webcomic,  Asking You  (available for free on Tapas, Webtoons and INKR), and have since been planning to change my focus from being a freelance illustrator to being a full-time comic author! Telling stories, creating characters and building worlds are things I've been passionate about since I was young but had only given myself a chance to do so recently. This patreon marks the first step of my journey on becoming a  full-time comic author & original content creator  and I'd be thrilled to have you along the way!   ✦   T H E    F O C U S   ✦ My main interests as an artist are cute boys, LGBTQ+ couples (mostly gay), cute mascots and NSFW art! So if you're into any of that this patreon might be something you could be interested in! You can expect to see here:  sketches, art processes, finished artworks, HD and clean versions of the latters, timelapses, PSD files and more! You can also peek into the full process it takes me to develop my webcomic's chapters and have an idea of what's going to happen before anyone else! As I have stated on the previous section, I mostly focus on  original content  so there won't be any fanart in this patreon.   ✦  T H E    G O A L  ✦ Aside from sharing my original characters and ideas, my goal is to be able to make a living out of something I'm passionate about and be able to donate to causes I believe in! Once I'm able to make enough to pay for my living expenses, I plan on donating a portion of what I make to charities and organizations that help out the LGBTQ+ community and other causes.   ✦  P R O J E C T S  ✦ • Asking You:   current webcomic I'm working on! It's a BL/LGBTQ+ comic that wants to subvert the usual tropes found in BL comics and also give representation to types of characters/people not always positively represented in the media. • Anatahi:   future webcomic featuring my two first original characters! Although this comic won't be worked on until Asking You is over, I still do art featuring the two main characters and have done a Huevember project in 2019 with them. • CMYK Models:   a series of comic strips I plan to work on along with Asking You. CMYK Models follow a pan-asian group of young male models and their daily adventures. NSFW content will mainly focus on the characters present in the CMYK Models & Asking You universes.   ✦  T H A N K    Y O U  ✦ If you read all this rant, thank you so much! Whether you decide to become a patron or not, I already thank you immensely for taking the time to read about me and my work! To those who do decide to help me reach my goal by becoming a patron, I couldn't honestly put into words how grateful I am to you and your support! By supporting me here, I hope we can build a trust basis relationship and that you can help me shape this patreon into something that will fit your interests and expectations more and more! And if for whatever reason you can't help me financially, please consider following me on my social medias and/or keep an eye on my comics! Thank you very much again! - nori.

Lately I've been drawing lots of fanart for Stranger Things and My Hero Academia. I also occasionally post furry content, and behind the scenes of merchandise I'm creating! GOALS I began my freelancing career in early 2016 and have since worked with hundreds of clients around the world. It was such a joy to work with customers to bring their ideas to life! For many years, I made my living purely off commissions, which hardly left any room for personal work. Over the years, though, our Patreon family has grown to a point where I'm now able to start focusing primarily on creating fanart and merchandise! Prints, charms, enamel pins, stickers, and even plushies are all items that are currently available in my shop! All of this has been made possible by my patrons. PERKS OF BEING A PATRON On Patreon, I will be sharing artwork that would otherwise never be posted publicly. In addition to Patreon exclusive art, you will also receive access to behind the scenes WIPs, hi-res illustrations, and coupon codes for my SaberGhatz Shop! Patrons of $3+ will also receive access to my NSFW [18+] content. Almost all of my 18+ art is exclusive to Patreon. On top of that, you will have my appreciation and gratitude. Every dollar goes towards making art a stable form of income, and allows me to pursue my dream of being an independent artist.  By pledging, you are supporting me both financially and mentally, and I for that am extremely grateful!

This is my patreon campaign where you can receive multiple benefits depending on how much you give me monthly. There are additional benefits not covered down the tier list that I'll go over further below. Why should I pledge to you? If you enjoy my art and wish to support me, that's good enough a reason! I'm currently working freelance to provide a lot of content and work on multiple other projects. I keep myself busy most days and am constantly striving to improve my art every year. Donating to me will not only net you some cool rewards, but also keep a roof above my head and ensure that I can continue creating new and exciting content! Wait, there doesn't seem to be much art here... I have recently moved all my art to my Discord server! You will need to access it in order to see my art from here on out, but luckily, making a Discord account and connecting it via Patreon is quite simple! Here is how to make the connection:  https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/212052266-How-do-I-receive-my-Discord-role- You mentioned additional benefits? Yes! First and foremost, depending on your tier, you can get discounts if you are chosen for a commission slot. You can also reach milestones in your pledge amount in order to receive special Tokens that you can use for two different rewards. More on that below. Are there Milestone rewards? Yes! In addition to the benefits above, if you accumulate increments of  $250  in donations, you will be given a Milestone Token, which you can spend on art by talking to Fid in Discord. While I am more lenient with Milestone rewards, please keep in mind my preferences which you can see on my FA:  https://www.furaffinity.net/user/fidchellvore/ You can see how many tokens you have by checking out my Trello:  https://trello.com/b/rmnPx5SB/fids-notebook PLEASE DO NOT PLEDGE A CUSTOM AMOUNT AS I CANNOT TRACK THIS AND WILL LIKELY SKIP OVER YOUR NAME ACCIDENTALLY WHEN GIVING OUT TOKENS. ONLY PLEDGE WITH THE LISTED TIERS OR GO FOR ANNUAL PAYMENT. How do I determine how many tokens I have? In my Trello, if your name is under the Milestone list, you can see two numbers next to each other. Let's use 0/2 for example. The left number, 0, is the amount of tokens that you USED. The right number, 2, is the amount you HAVE overall. Hope that covers most everything. If you still have questions, feel free to shoot me a message.  Thanks for considering being my patron!"},

This Patreon is used to support me as an artist and helps me produce more art each month! The Patreon’s main feature is monthly voting that allows you to influence the content I create. Higher tiers give you more votes on what characters you want to see, plus some bonus privileges. There are four tiers: The basic  $1 “Floof” tier  lets you see all the art I post here before it’s uploaded to FA. The next step up is the  $3 “Fox” tier , which allows you to vote in the monthly “furbait” polls. These polls determine which character I’ll draw for the monthly image. After that is the  $10 “Kitsune” tier , which gives you six votes on the monthly furbait poll instead of just one.

I have worked in the game industry for 15+ years and started my career working for Blizzard Entertainment. After that, I joined Riot Games, designing many iconic and fun characters for League of Legends for the past 10 years. I went to Art Center College of Design in Pasadena 3 years before leaving to join Riot. I am a mostly self-taught artist. I really enjoyed creating powerful, yet beautiful female characters. I often draw my own feelings and even draw and paint female character portraits for fun in my personal time! Over the years, many aspiring artists have requested that I do mentorship or teaching a class. Since I’ve been in their shoes, starting in the art career before, I wanted to help make a difference in sharing my knowledge effectively. Why Support? Your generous support will help me focus on personal artworks and Your donations will help fund projects: Deathverse and Mekanizer series into artbooks and possibly something bigger! What's included in the Batch? Rewards for supporting my project and art creations!  For more info, check out the Rewards column! :D What sort of Content? \n I love creating Original Characters from scratch! I'm also a big gamer and Anime watcher, meaning I love to create fan tribute arts in my own style. I mostly enjoy painting portraits and character design pieces. From doodle sketches, to final rendering, I'll share them all with you as appreciation for the support.  Sometimes I make Artistic Nude Pinup Art which can be NSFW. Here's how Patreon Content Cycle Works! (Like Magazine Subscription) Each month has to two Batches of contents (B1, B2, and B3) Each Batch is two weeks of content  B1 is first half of the month and B2 is last half of the month.  To receive the B1 Content, its best to pledge within day 1 - 10 of the month.  To receive the B2 Content, its best to pledge within day 10 - 20 of the month. To receive the B3 Content, its best to pledge within day 20 - 30 of the month. All three of the contents get processed at the start of next month and sent out shortly after.  Example:  B1, B2, and B3 of  February  2021  Content, will begin processing on  March 1st 2021 . . Once everything is processed, then the contents are sent out to the processed patrons by  March 7th 2021 . \nAppreciation Rewards will be sent out on the first week of each month to the patrons!

Web-res  finished images are posted in the  feed , earlier than in my FA or Twitter galleries.

Each month I make a list of characters in a new poll in the Patreon feed that people vote on. I put up space for 6 chars! $5+ patrons can give one vote and $10+ patrons can either vote for two character or give two votes for one character. If you want some old content . Once a month, after your current pledge processes ($5+), you can send me a PM requesting one of MONTHLY (not year, comic or pinups) archives for free:  https://gumroad.com/iskra $10+ patrons may additionally request any 3 pages of any of the comics! (You can also send me a link to my older artwork(s) you'd like to get hi-res of and I'll find the archive(s) containing them ^^) Regarding tags: I've added some tags to my all of my posts for easier search! Species tags are not always exact, though: they're mostly there to categorize the type of character's features like \"tiger\" can also mean a leopard, and \"wolf\" can also be a jackal, etc :)"},

One week a month is dedicated to the comic Multiversal Feast, whereas the rest of the month is dedicated to the rest of the current comics. Also, every two months, Special Weeks with varying themes are held, with a focus on patrons choosing what they want to see such as Q&As, Choose Your Own Adventure Comics, Themed Illustrations, and more! You can\nsupport my work in several ways! Depending on what you pledge, you will get the\nfollowing: When you join, you will receive current comics in the works, this is done by email. To get access to previous and complete comics of your TIER, payment of your pledge must have gone through for a second time, as well as be a member for at least 1 month, that means 30 days ( This rule is for both new patrons and old patrons that come back. Please let me know if you have been a member for 1 month!! It's difficult to keep track of all of my patrons, so please let me know. ) Here is a list of all the previous complete works according to what you pledge: Every update is sent through e-mail.  Also, I will make posts to notify patrons that I have sent updates. Be sure that the e-mail you provided for Patreon is the one you wish to receive the updates in. I use the charge up front system , I made a post about it here:  https://www.patreon.com/posts/5461947 Since July 2020,  Patreon has decided to add a sale tax to patron pledges  to some parts of the US and other 15 countries. Read the following post for more info regarding it:  https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/360... **If you have questions before joining the Patreon, please send me an e-mail here:  [email protected] , I will be glad to answer any doubts you have.** \n DISCLAIMER:  Before\nContributing anything, you acknowledge you are 18 years old or older. You can choose to end\nyour support at any time!"},

This Patreon will be able to give me the time and resources to create the content I want (illustrations, animations, and other). A majority of  the content that I'll be focusing on: some animations I have always wanted to tackle, storyboard projects, and a short comic series. I want to create some big projects, which will require a good amount of resources: mics, programs, editing software, better computer, etc... So best case scenario, I can gain enough funding to project this forward and you guys can be by my side. I am eternally grateful for your donations and constant support.

It's always been a (farfetched) dream of mine to work on comics and artwork for a living. My patrons here have made that dream a reality! Thanks to their support through Patreon, I'm making more original furry artwork than I could have possibly before. So how does it work? When you become a patron, you get access to my comics, pinups, livestreams, sketches, hi-res PSD's, tutorials, short stories, lore and more. You'll also be able to vote in polls for future content! There are always two comics on the go, Cinderfrost and an erotic mini-comic! The amount of content you get is decided by which reward tier you choose. If you're interested, here's how it works:\n \nIn the past, patrons had to wait until the end of the month when their pledges were processed to get access to the content. Now, patreon processes your pledge as soon as you become a patron, giving you immediate access to the content! All your following pledges are processed at the beginning of the month, and you can cancel, raise, or lower your pledge at any time! \n Is it all released publicly or is the content exclusive? \nMost of the content is released publicly on a delay, either on Furaffinity (demicoeur) or Twitter (@demicoeurart)! The content in the Fancy Feline tier isn't public because most of these are extras, blog posts, writing, and not as easy to share anyway. There are also things like pinups with multiple versions, where only one version is made public. High resolution files are only accessible here as well! The Patreon is mostly for people who want to support me or access the content as soon as I create it so they get all the juicy details asap, rather than waiting for my public updates.   \n Thanks  to my readers and fans of my artwork for continuing to support my work, and thanks to anyone who decides to pledge. I hope you enjoy the things I create as much as I enjoyed making them!"},

I'm Kitsune Chon, I'm from Russia. Drawing has been my favorite activity since my earliest childhood. I dreamt about working as an illustrator, but I am an architect by profession. While I was studying at the university, I became interested in comics and manga. After graduating in 2013, I started working as a general plan engineer and at the same time, finally, started drawing my manga. For me, it has become a perfect way of self-expression. There is nothing better than to come up with a story and show it exactly as you intended. I realized that I would like to do this not as a hobby, but as my permanent occupation. In 2017, to free up more time for creativity, I sterted a job as a teacher in studio of art. In this studio I also opened my own comics course. Although it was interesting, it took a lot of energy and time. Now I can finally devote myself to my favorite activity: I create my own comics and illustrate fantasy books. In my works, I try to keep a balance between drama and comedy. It’s important for me to show social problems in Russian society, as well as to show the bright sides, such as friendship, support, love, parental love. I think, it will be interesting for anyone who has not been to Russia to learn more about this country through my characters. Now I'm working on: \"Not Serious about Serious\" The situation takes place in Russia in real conditions, but this story may be close to everyone, because it talks about friendship, love, relationships with parents, difficulties with society and difficulties that LGBTQ+ people have to face with in Russia. This story is about childhood injuries, losses and how to live with it. Нow to decide on a relationship with a person of your own sex in a society where anyone can condemn it. How to sort out problems in a relationship if you can't always understand yourself and you don't want to put them on the one you love. Vasilyi is a student of architectural college. He is shy, modest but very kind person. Thanks to Alexander, his school life is very adventurous and cheerful. Alexander is the center of every company and everybody loves him. What could connect such different people? And why friends are always teasing them about their another kind of relations? Maybe they should really think about situation and why they feel so good near each other? Or they should continue kicking around this topic? The thing is that its always much easier to talk about serious stuff in not serious manner. https://tapas.io/series/Not_Serious_About_Serious https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/not-serious-... \"Fucking Saturday!\" This story shows how hard and painful it is to hide who you are, constantly being in stress, lie and hide facts about yourself. Anothef challenge is related to working in educational institutions, if you are an LGBTQ+ person in Russia, where there is a stupid law about LGBT propaganda. With all that, the main character decides to take a step to find his happiness. His partner turns out to be his absolute opposite: open, bright, noisy. He is happy to emphasize his individuality and distinctiveness from others in every possible way. In Dima's life everything is stable and quiet. Home-job-home. He perfectly adapted in this life, knowing how to hide himself. Dima has already decided to live all his life like that - hiding in the closet. The plan was perfect. But one time, social media showed Dima something in recommendations that he could not refuse. https://tapas.io/series/Fucking_Saturday https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/fucking-satu... \"Pawlik\" (on pause) Pawlik the fox has almost become adult. Now he has to figure out all the stuff by himself: how many snags he has to pay for apartment, should he take off his tongue in the public transportation when it's hot, how not to spend all leaves on socks. In an adult world you have to be very serious, but Pawlik's head is full of pink ducks and racoons-austronauts - they are his friends and he doesn't wanna leave them. https://tapas.io/series/Pawlik_Eng https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/pawlik/list?...

I want to create erotic materials that focus on charming, comedic character interaction, unorthodox and varied body types, and a positive, mutually satisfactory approach to sex between partners (Translation: I want to draw a lot of weird monster characters going at it in goofy ways). NOTE:  Although I like drawing \"cute\" erotica, I will not, and will never post art featuring any underage/questionably of-age characters and any request to do so will result in an immediate block. Currently, I'm only offering character nudes, pin-ups, and simple smut comics, however, I will post updates on other adult projects I might be working on, and I still intend to produce a follow-up to Hellmouth To Mouth, along with other adult comics.

However if you support me, you will immediately gain access to a plethora of art I have already created (the Daily Artworks I have done in the past 1,5 years is 370 art files alone!) and I believe it will be worth your while :) I will not be able to make refunds or replying to messages at this time, as I will not be able to do anything other than commiting to being a fulltime mom of two precious boys. Thank you for your understanding! And a thousand thanks to everyone who chooses to support me during this challenging time for me and my family! Hey! My name is Lana!   I ' m a  Polish freelance adult artist .\nI'm also a mom to a lovely energetic toddler and am pregnant with my second child. I am trying my best to\nbalance being a parent and working. I've been doing commissions for a\nliving for many years already, but I want to focus on developing my\nown projects too. I'm here because I want to create my own comics, long\nand short, erotic and adventure, fantasy and sci-fi, thrilling and heartwarming. I can only make\nthis dream come true  with your generous help . I'm trying my best to be one of the  most active Patreon furry accounts , as well as build a welcoming and  warm community on our Discord channel ! If you decide to support me, please make sure to add your Discord info to your Patreon profile and you will be automatically added to the server!  You will get exclusive access to snip-its and teasers of what I am working on, on a daily basis :) My main focus is  female character art, mostly erotic or suggestive  (somtimes also explicit). I love focusing on  anatomy and saturated colors  while rendering. Thanks to your support here I can make sure I can make drawing my fulltime job and provide my best quality art for you every day! WHAT CAN YOU FIND ON THIS PATREON? This is a  very active Patreon,   I post content almost daily ! At 3$ a month Exclusive access to erotic artworks   (3-5 a week) All my art in high resolution  as well as it's  alternative versions  a month earlier than the public snip-it spoilers and wips  of the art I'm currently working on ( shared on the Discord server to avoid cluttering the Patreon feed ) At 6$ a month The tier specific rewards are put on hold until further notice, due to my current health and life situation and until I am able to find enough time to resume the project again. \n Comic pages   in high resolution  and  6 months ahead of the public Exclusive access too all behind the scenes work for the comic , character and places concepts etc. At 15$ a month \n Step by step images ,\n speedpaints  and  PSD files  of most of my artworks  Constant access to my  commission queue  (read below) Fast fingers commissions  - Discord is required, claim the slot for tomorrow's daily artwork once I announce an opening and get your artwork within the next day  (4-5 sold a month) ABOUT THE CONTENT The content I create is aimed towards  adult audiences only . As to what I produce - I mainly work with  lady and feminine pinups, suggestives and erotic art . However I also like to spice things up, as well as tone them down and draw simple slice of life scenes. I also draw  adult art featuring men , but recently way less often. I am always open to tackle those subjects as commissions though, so don't hesitate to ask me about them! PANDORA'S BOX Pandora's box is a very limited tier.   Once a month, a daily sketch goes to your character as an artisit freedom monochromatic sketch. </h5> The range will vary from a  halfbody  to a  fullbody  depending on the idea I have in mind. I will choose the day on which I will create your sketch, so it will be a surprise! These sketches are excluded from the monthly refining vote. The quality of the Pandora's box sketches is the same as the daily sketches:  a monochromatic sketch , like the examples posted  here . If you'd like your  Pandora's box sketch to be refined  on any level (colored sketch, full render etc.) you can always do it once I reached your turn in the commission queue. The price will be based on my regular  commission prices   -85$  :) PATRON COMMISSIONS INFO Check my Patron commission queue All Patrons of  tier 15$+ have regular access to my commissions . For Patrons I offer:  monochromatic sketches, colored sketches, rendered sketches, simple renders  and  reference sheets   (more info on each type  here ) The reference sheet queue is a separate one from the other commissions  (so while applying for a reference, please mention it and you will be listed in the appropriate queue) If you want to be added to the commission queue , please just @me on the Discord server in the #commissions channel or PM me on Patreon You need to be my  active Patron  so I can conntact you about the commission, once it's your turn. If you drop your pledge as I reach your turn, I won't be able to conntact you and you will be removed from the queue. You can only be listed in the commission queue once.  One slot is one artwork  (but you can join both queues - regular coms and the reference sheet queue) . Once I am done with your order, you can ask to be placed in the queue again! You won't be asked for any payment until I reach your spot in the queue. If for whatever reason you cannot undertake the commission once I reach your turn,  I am open for rescheduling it   (you can just be placed behind the next person in queue and asked again once I am done with their commission, so there is no need to wait all over again). I accept flexible payment plans for all commissions. The only rule being - you won't receive the finished artwork until the whole payment has been made. Terms of Service  ♥  FAQ  ♥  Prices, examples and current commission queue Thank you so much for your huge interest! MY COMIC PROJECT: BUBBLEGUM \n Chew\nor be chewed.

All comics produced via this patreon  will be free to read once completed  but  supporters here get early access to all the pages as soon as they're complete  and  access to all my behind the scenes work  such as thumbnails, full scripts and 3D models. My goal shows the  minimum number of pages  i'm able to make each month with the current funding, I'll likely create more but just to give you an idea :^) Monthly illustrations:  I'll also be creating monthly illustrations based on a poll with this patreon that members of the Paint, Final Touches and PotA tiers can have exclusive content of"},

I strive towards having my art be free access to everyone, forever. Alas, an artist must eat. So, Patreon is very much my venue for realizing that goal. With funds from Patreon to pay my living expenses, I can spend more time just pumping out quality content for all of you, and less time hunting for contract and commission work. That said, for those who want to give a little more, I do offer some juicier rewards in the form of Work Files and Timelapse Recordings of my art process, for those who have an interest in that~ Thank you for taking your time to read this page, and your consideration.

It's how it works, so for convenience, please time your first pledge on the beginning days of the month (1st-15th) if you don't want to be charged twice in a short period of time. Hello and welcome to my Patreon page! Here you will find all my public and exclusive work. I mainly focus on the horror niches of erotic art, so if you're sensitive with this topic but still want great content, I suggest you head over to amazing artists such as  Squarepeg3D  or  StevenCarson , just to name a couple. As of right now, I'm following SP3D's rolemodel on delivering content through Patreon and guidelines, so here's some important info: The works you'll find here are explicit 18+ renders and comics in which  all characters depicted are of legal age, consenting adults  and  all erotic acts are consensual, despite the horror connotation . All scenarios and characters are fictional and not meant to represent any real persona, and  any resemblance to real world people is not premeditated, they're coincidental . Think of my content as movies and the characters are the actors, they're performing an act where all parties are consent to said acts and the emotions displayed are simply theatrical.  All explicit content is hosted in a third-party service in an attempt to comply with  Patreon's Community Guidelines . So with the important stuff out of the way, let's clarify some questions with a quick Q&A: 1. What kind of horror will I see in your Patreon page? A: The horror I focus on are characters of generally ugly, hideous or scary nature, much alike the classic horror movie genre (witches, frankensteins, mummies, swamp hags, ghosts and many others). I gather reference from various places and my characters not copies of any content already made, so I try to create personality and backstory by patching up folklore, movies, famous tales, video games and others to bring you something you may be familiar with but it's entirely new. A great example of this is Olga, the swamp hag that probably brought you here, she's the classic green witch from deep within the forests/swamps but she has her own backstory and concept behind her. 2. Do you take requests? A: As of right now,  no . I am not currently taking requests despite the tiers your might have pledged to, but I might consider some stuff if the idea resonates with what I already have in mind, so feel free to share your desires! Just don't expect too much because it might not happen. But then again, it might as well. It's a gamble."},

I look forward to sharing my future projects and discussing the subject with you! \n What is your charging method? - I opted for the \"Monthly recharge mode\". \n \n When do you send the 3D Works packages? \n\t - This archive gathering the illustrations published during the month of your support on my Patreon is sent on the 6th of each month. \n \n What does mean “AD-Games”? \n\t - Ad-games means \"Adult Games\" but that doesn't mean I play xD games \n \n I can't find your videos, how can I see them? \n - My videos will all soon be available on  NewGround . \n I'm new, how do I get the previous monthly plans? - Voir  i ci  (patreon) Where can I see your old work? - For the most part, you can find them on Furaffinity and on Twitter. The most recent works are posted first on my Patreon and later on my FA and Twitter accounts. Why are the images of your patreons not of high quality? -  I publish 720p versions of my work in low quality in order to limit theft. You will receive the images produced during the month of your monthly plan commitment on the 6th of the month following your Patreon commitment. I subscribed to your patreon on March 4, will I receive a package on March 6? - No because the packages are always delivered with one month delay. If you registered on March 4, you will receive the March package on April 6 ... I have been supporting your work for two months, but never received the monthly packages. - It is likely that your payments have been delayed. Indeed, I distribute the monthly plans on the 6th of each month in order to limit the incidence of the \"refused\" status. If your payment was made after the 6th of the month, contact me by private message so that I can send you your due. I signed up in March and left at the end of the month. Why haven't I received the monthly plan? - You canceled your commitment before the debit date, that is to say the first day of the following month. How many works does each package contain? - About ten. Do the packages contain videos? - It's not my main activity. What's your favorite race? -  Orcs, of course ... but I really like centaurs and anthro characters. How old are you ? - Uh ... the age of my birth xD \n \n\"Makn'i & Zor\" For the translation of my work. \"Scarmet\" For the translation of my work. \"Merfiller\" for his incredible illustration of my Orc Morok. \"Basch\" for drawing the stickers for my character Orc Kurdan.

You must be of legal age to become a supporter. Hi, I'm DreamAndNightmare, a self taught digital artist from Germany. I have been drawing furry art ever since 2006. It has become a passion of mine and I do it as a full time artist ever since 2015. While my art remains freely accessible through my various galleries on FurAffinity, InkBunny, SoFurry, Twitter and DeviantArt, I want to use Patreon as a means to allow people to support me and my work. This Patreon is mainly to be seen as an ability to donate money and not as a paywall. Which is why every tier allows you full access to the original resolution files of my pictures. The exceptions are commissioned pictures, as I believe a commissioner should have the exclusive rights to those files - as they have paid for it. If a commissioner allows me to post those files here, I will do so with their consent. Thanks for taking your time to check out my page and thank you very much for your support!"},

This type of image creation has fascinated me a lot lately. Plus I have plans in the future to develop more complex projects from the skills gained from creating images.   All the models that are in the images are created by me. The creation of each of the character models takes place in several long stages. They are different from the original characters, since I make some changes to each model, I try to do better in my presentation. The skill is actively growing, which makes it possible with each new creation of the character to make tangible steps forward.   I am constantly improving the quality of my content. I try to make it more interesting, I often set myself difficult tasks, I study and improve.      You will be able to participate in different polls (choice between characters, universes), watch news about the work process and plans, directly ask questions of interest to you and offer any ideas. I am open to new interesting ideas.   You can support me if you like my work. Your support will help me a lot in my development, it is very important for every artist.      All characters are over 18 years old. My work is fanart, parodies and fantasies!"},

After showing some of her characters to fans through video thumbnails,streams, and two animatics fans began to ask for more. After one other animatic both a fan and the artist behind Caotico Comics suggested making comic books instead and so Caotico Comics was born. Now Caotico Comics works on such comics as Chaotic Stories as well as Stunning Shock. We hope through this Patreon to bring you other fantastic comics and series as we continue to grow and maybe someday return to animation to really bring our stories and yours to life!

So… why Patreon, you might ask? \n \nPatreon isn’t just for new artists. In fact, I see it as a great platform for someone like myself who’s eager to discover a brand new way of making his art accessible and to get to know the people who love what I do. \n \n \nI’ve been drawing hot naked guys and creating XXX gay comics for more than 20 years now, and after all this time, I’ve decided that I want to mix things up a little bit – you know, keep things fresh. I’ve been looking for a way to have more direct contact with the people who support me and my work, and this seems to be the right place for it. \n \n \nBy supporting me here, you’re helping me create new illustrations – some of my own original character creations, and some fan arts of pop culture favorites. I’ll also be working on new comics that you will get to see here before anyone else. \n \n \nI have a lot of great stuff planned, and I can’t wait to share it all with you guys. Thank you so much for your support – we’re gonna have a ton of fun together. \n \n \nHugz + kisses, guys -- Patrick XOXO \n \n"},

I'm so happy to share with you my exclusive art content, and much much more! I go by Ink or Inky; I'm 27 years old, half Indigenous/Cherokee (what's up my brothers and sisters), I'm a baby Witch in training, and I've always dreamed of getting kittens dumped on my face :D Before I became a full-time freelance artist during February of 2021, I was a security officer and a police cadet in training. I love to help and guide people, however, the occupation itself didn't really seem to be what I was looking for, and it terrified me at the time.  Ever since I was little, I've always loved to draw, and it wasn't until I was 12 that I realized that drawing is my passion. I've studied different art styles and tutorials on my own, self-taught when it came to connecting with my own style and technique, and I became so good at it, that I decided to slowly build up a story of my own.  The comic that I currently have on Webtoon has been with me for many years, and has been through SO MANY changes before I began publicly showing it. By the time I received enough support from you and many other patrons on here, I was able to quit my toxic job, get out of the academy, and become a full-time artist--and I LOVE it, and forever am grateful!  To finally have the time and opportunity to work on this comic, and other art content, is the best thing that any young artist can ever dream of, and I intend to have you and my other supporters tag along with me on this wonderful journey. I WANT you to experience the work in progress of this comic, I want you to see it grow, and to feel and understand the joy and excitement I feel when I post something about it; whether it be a character's bio, concept art, notes for the storyline, etc.! I want you to be a part of it, and with that, I thank you for coming along, and I do hope you can stay long enough to watch this comic reach to the moon! Much love ♥ ©inkedalpha"},

I'm  InDarkWaters , a wannabe artist that always admired game creators, artists and their work. As a kid I always wrote stories and made small games with every kind of software that I could get my hands on, no matter how unpractical. I always wanted to create art and games that touch or connect people and give them something to look back to. Since I was never that talented I always thought of it as nothing more than a child's dream though. Since I never really found a direction in life that I wanted to go I got to a phase where I din't really know what to do with myself anymore.  That's why I thought I give myself a push try to start what I always dreamed of as a kid! About what Im doing For now I'm doing nothing more than drawing cute Images and animations for practice and everyone to see.  I love games, anime and monster girls. (What also makes me a fan of some furry related stuff) So gaming and anime related stuff like pokemon is probably what most of my art will be about for now. I also like working on NSFW stuff, so depending on the demand and how I feel you can expect these kind of things too. ;D At the moment I'm working on a Braixen Visual Novel. A project that I use to start out with, so a lot of the stuff in the game won't have the quality yet that it needs to be called an actual game. But I hope to learn from it and maker better things to share with you in the future! Why would you want to support me? Sadly It still takes a lot of time and effort for me to create art and games like this and personal life also doesn't always make it easy... Your support would allow me to keep going with my work and increase it's quality along the line, hopefully making me produce more stuff that you like. It's also just a good way to say that you care and like my work, what gives me even more motivation and let's me keep going! Future and rewards As for now I don't yet have any kind of rewards for support beside my gratitude and the knowledge that you keep me going. I want to add some in the future though, where I upload high resolution pictures of my drawings, special versions of games and animations I release and polls about what you want to see next. Maybe even some personal commissions or fanarticle if you would like those. That's all up to how it goes and what you guys want though, so let me know! So if you like what I did so far or just want to help me become better and see more of my work in the future feel free to support me and I hope you keep enjoying my art even then! Thank's for your interest. :3"},

In short, I'm a fully independent comic artist. I write and illustrate comics because it's what I love to do. YES, it's way more work than a simple drawing, but it is way more rewarding for both me and you to get to the end-product after a month or two of work on a 20 page issue.    There is a  LOT  of work that goes into my comic-creating process and I'm starting this Patreon as a way for you to get  more involved  and  more aware  of the work that goes on during production. I'm excited about this venture because it offers a way to show  sneak peeks  to  only those who want them.      Maybe you want more than sneak peeks?       If so, my Patreon will  also  give you ways to share ideas about the comic in every level of the creative process. Give input on  character design ,  concept art ,  story  structure and style,  color or lighting choices - share your opinion on any step of the process and see it all come together from beginning to end. This Patreon experience is here to  build your knowledge and experience with each new comic. *Okayokayokok comics are centered around fetish themes and intended for a mature audience 18+ years of age."},

After gaining a 2:1 degree in Illustration I fell into 6 long years of soul destroying call centre work which crippled my creativity and I became deeply unhappy. It wasnt until I was made redundant in 2014 where I took the plunge and made a real effort to make a living off of my work. I promised myself that I would never again sacrifice my happiness and my passion for a job. Now, several years later and with the help from my wonderful Patreon supporters, I’m so happy to be able to give back to them. Rewards such as first dibs on all items for sale including some very highly prized artist proof prints featuring commissioned work from Metallica, Pink Floyd and Magic the Gathering as well as my own tees and prints which often sell out when announced publicly. Having Patreon allows me to work on personal and soulful art which makes the happiest and it’s with thanks to the Patreon Pack that I can be picky with who I work for.  Join your Wolf Family  We are a very supportive and caring group here on Patreon and like to welcome new members to the Pack!  Your support of any amount will gain you exclusive access to sketches, works in progress, personal diary posts, Sketch requests, first dibs on all art for sale, discounts, and tips and articles on what I have learned in the art industry and how I can try and help you with your art (If you too are an artist).  I am still learning, but as I go I wish to help as many people as possible to find their way in this very competitive industry.   I am incredibly prolific and upload most days. I am also very open here about what is going on in my life and I like to think that Patreon is my safe place where I can fully express who I am as a person as well as an artist. I am still trying to find my way but I hope that you can join me on this journey. What you get  All Pack members from $2 upwards get access to most content including first dibs on all items for sale and shop discount codes! This can also include very highly desirable band posters and Artist Proof prints from my larger clients. Please note that if you’re ONLY here for band posters/APs these jobs are a very small part of my overall job and are not guaranteed.  I do not recommend joining JUST to score artist proofs. However if you like the rest of my work too as well as the clients I work for, this might be the place for you! By giving you guys first dibs your chances of getting rare items increases dramatically. All $10 plus subscribers have access to a PDF of my first written book Fall of Redd (which can be found in the tab on the bottom left when joining the Pack) and all $50 plus subscribers get presents for Christmas and Easter posted to them from the UK! All sketch rewards are also mailed to you and when I release a new book, you will be thanked by name in the book itself.  You can quit at any time and no questions will be asked! I'm grateful for all and any support at all!  What I ask of you Please make sure your address is up to date!  If you do not wish to receive gifts in the post please contact me and we can arrange something else.   You are under no obligation and can cancel at any time! If you decide to change how much you want to donate per month to suit your budget, that's fine too!  Thank you for your support!  With Love and howls, WolfSkullJack x"},

You'll need a Discord account to join my Patron-exclusive Discord server and see my full, uncensored artwork! Yo! I'm Contingency, a hentai artist and smut writer who's had a casual web presence since around 2012. In the years I've made this stuff, it's always just been a hobby, a way to use my artwork and writing to harmlessly explore some more risqué kinks - those kinks have changed over the years,  but over time I've largely settled on the themes that I like to make: that means a lot of MILFs, a lot of thick-booty femboys, general size queening and alpha dom worship, and most of all, cheating and cuckolding porn.  And now, many years after I started dabbling with all this as a hobby, I'm hoping that with your support, I'll be able to continue making art with those themes full time. The form this full time output takes depends on how much support I get here on Patreon. For several years now, in order to boost my income, I've relied largely on commissions, which has meant a lot less original stuff with my own characters and ideas.  My revamped Patreon's main goal is to ensure that I can do a LOT more original artwork with Patron input via votes and comments - eventually, if I can reach a certain stable level of support on here, I might even end up doing nothing but daily original artwork, and even start to include doujin-style short comics, bi-weekly short smut stories, and more. That, of course, is likely down the road a bit.  So to start, Patrons will receive three pieces of content per regular week, consisting of two commissions per week and one piece of content that you all suggest and then vote on at the beginning of every week.  The more support I can build up here, the more the focus will shift to more original stuff, and less commissions, though I'll never fully stop taking commissions to help bring peoples' smutty ideas to life. I know paywalls aren't peoples' favorite thing - they're certainly not mine. That said, I like to think I help address a certain niche in hentai that doesn't get a lot of love from western artists - so I hope if you like what I make and want to see a lot more of it, you'll consider chipping in as little as the price of a cup of coffee every month to get full access to three new detailed artworks per week!"},

I'm also drawn to the concept of the legendary centaur. \n Where can I see your art? \nFor the past two years I have been sharing my artwork at  https://www.deviantart.com/liminalbean"},

I want to see how far I can get as an artist if I dedicate my heart and soul to this. Every single bit of your support helps me get closer to that goal. Supporting me here gives you a few perks such as seeing new pics earlier than everyone else, or being able to check out WIPs of comics and games, you can even get on a Discord server to chat directly with me at any time!

This is a chance to make more engaging tailored content and importantly having fun art-making, producing that adult content you all love along the way. With additional insight into work in progresses, processes and upcoming stuff! What it means though? This for the most part is a tip jar with some behind-the-scenes. A little added income would help tremendously in opportunities to experiment and really push myself in areas beyond that that I already do for commissions. Be it pushing new styles, settings, buff anatomy--  No image gating . I'm not putting any finished work behind a paywall, no threat.  If anything I want to be more open with the work that goes on behind the scenes,  WIP's sketches, rough ideas , the likes. I'll post things here  first  before I do elsewhere (Twitter/FA), it'll  only  be staggered by a day or two. Sketches, studies, step-by-step and further learning. I produce a lot of roughs along the way, with some deconstruction and written stuff too! They might be useful to some, and interesting to others. The possibility for more streaming during the week and for some smaller more interactive groups, be that Q&A or art demonstration (to the best of my knowledge!) I'LL BE ABLE TO DO MORE WORK AND POST MORE WORK! <3 I'm  not  selling commissions through here! TUTORING- What you'll receive? An hour of my time to sit and... perhaps you'd like me to look over a picture you're having issues with, or some thoughts on anatomy, how to push the things that are working in your style- However you think I can help, I will do my utmost to be of help! Can of course screenshare and talk over voice (skype all being well). Remember my practice is mostly with Photoshop/SAI if you're working digitally (and if you're traditional, you'll need digital copies/scans/photos). However most programs end up having the same sets of tools, if working digitally is something you'd like advice with. I'll offer 8 slots, so that means 2 people per week of the month, and will ramp this up if its successful and people find it beneficial! I'll organize time slots for anywhere between 12am and 12pm GMT on Saturday or Sunday and will give warning of any changes. DISCLAIMER- IMPORTANT- This is tailored 1 on 1 sessions. NOT a structured tutorial. Meaning its down to you what we cover. Bare in mind what my experience is in and how I'll be able to help -you-. So, if you're looking for some help with drawing or colouring for instance, or perhaps feel like you've stagnated and cant improve, I'll hopefully be able to give better advice. I'll contact you prior for skype info and briefly discuss what you're looking for so that I can come prepared."},

We're making interactive entertainment themed around our (and hopefully your) adult fantasies. Our biggest dream is that  Dragons , big intelligent  Avians ,  Mammals ,  Dinosaurs , and other  beautiful creatures  were real as day, so you could talk to them, touch them, and they could touch you... Determined to bring them to reality in any way possible, that's why we're making a  Multiplayer Co-Op Adult Sandbox  Game (referred to as  TGOR ), which aims to capture what it would feel like to live as such creature. The gameplay Our goal is to give the players a unique freedom to immerse themselves in  alien worlds  and  interact organically  with the surroundings and their creature's  body , which includes all the  anatomically-essential  body-parts. The special  Sexual Interaction system  is just one part of the game's  life simulation  systems - we didn't shy away from other  organic processes  like food  digestion , reacting to  environment , and body  conditions  as well. Just having a working systemic body is not enough to create a complete game, of course. You can also  customize your creatures  and make new species, and to do that you will need to  explore  the realities,  research  technologies and get to intimately know other creatures to  collect  their genetic data. You'll need to use  crafting  to  survive  in harsh places,  restore  reality corruption, and  fight  harmful immaterial manifestations. The setting The game set in a science-fantasy setting, on a different plane of existence - a multiverse with its own set of natural laws. Different cultures there have their own morals and alien mentality, which doesn't share the human world outlook on what is good and bad. Playing on contrasts of various fantasies and fears, game levels are designed to bring out different emotions for every individual. It ultimately leaves it up to you to decide - what will it be, a gruesome, bloody, filthy darkness, or a positive, playful and naughty experience? Why we need your support With your support we get to do our beloved job of creating this game full time, that means we can focus on making more gameplay content updates that you enjoy! Furthermore, as support level increases, we will be able to afford hiring professionals to help with the game's progress, which is a big positive impact on quality and speed of development. Our Patrons get access to early prototype builds, exclusive development news, participate in testing sessions, polls, discussions of features. Some Patrons even sponsor us to create new content (messages, statues, body-parts) for the game! And of course, the biggest reward for everyone is that, with your support, the game will become a reality! Current state of the game While we had already produced  playable builds , those were just prototypes. For the past time we've been very busy on completely re-factoring the game, and while it took a lot of time, it resulted in us creating a full  mod support  and many other essential systems that would never been possible otherwise. For the new upcoming alpha builds we've created a roadmap, where even partially-completed tasks will be rich enough to show off the  gameplay  we've been laying foundations for. Community We are aiming to grow as a community, not just based around our game alone, but around all which we love - namely Dragons and other amazing, beautiful creatures, and being open about adult fantasies involving them! Role playing, tabletop games, game modding and server hosting, avatars for virtual worlds, downloadable 3D models - is all part of our growing, friendly and passionate community. Join our Discord to be a part of it! We're friendly and don't bite (unless asked nicely)!"},

Whats gonna be here? Good question!  For a while now, I've been contemplating an idea for making a comic for a long LONG time.  That comic is of course  HappyMart .  A little comic about my little cartoon characters delving into the sometimes harsh, sometimes rewarding, but NEVER dull world of retail...in a big box store to be more specific.  Some of the stories in which my characters are featured in are in fact based off  real life events  and stories that happened to yours truly when they held various odd jobs around a big box store.  Hey, sometimes the very BEST jokes stem from that of real life experience! But that's not all folks!   In addition to the comic, I'm also going to be posting some other cool stuff here, such as spiffy (and nice to look at)  wallpapers  in  4k  and various other artworks for the connoisseur of spicy (and perhaps a bit naughty) art.   In addition to this, I'll also be posting  sketches and scribbles  and other behind the scenes stuff that I also enjoy drawing.   *note that some of these images are for mature followers 18+ Thank you for your support! I LOVE making art for everybody.  Cartoons and comics are super fun, and I'd NEVER want to give it up.  I'd also like to make a living off of it someday.  Stuff costs money, not much getting around that.  Any kind of contribution is extremely appreciated, even a dollar a month helps!  But there is even more cool stuff waiting for those who decide to go the higher tier stuff, which is also SUPER awesome of you guys to do!  Your support also helps the art flow, so that new stuff is always coming through the pipes for you guys, so stay tuned.  Check out my other stuff! For those of you who aren't familiar with my other stuff, feel free to check them out! Twitter! My DeviantArt page! The Edtropolis Zone on Tumblr! Stay tuned, everybody!"},

Patreon Structure UPDATE (2021) I’ve recently spent some time reviewing my current Patreon rewards and I have made a few changes. There’s no need for panic, as the rewards will remain the same. Here are the big changes: Las Lindas and Knighthood will now alternate every comic update. Las Lindas and Knighthood will both be considered comic updates when calculating your donation. In the past, only Las Lindas would count for this.  I no longer have “bonus comics” as a reward goal. Both LL and KH are my main projects. Why am I doing this? The reason I made these changes is to help accelerate Knighthood toward its planned resolution while also getting paid to do it. Comic pages are 40+ hours of work and offering a comic page as a bonus reward was too much to handle. Now my patreon is focused on billing for all comic pages and everything else is a free reward. Knighthood is currently being planned to finish sooner than LL will. So if I keep it at a good pace, I can finish the project and focus on LL. I really don’t want to cancel any more of my projects. My long time fans will remember the pain of when I overloaded myself with comic projects. What will this look like for patrons? Patrons will receive one more page charge going forward per month. The other donation tiers are currently unchanged, but as we try out this new system, we might come back and review that.   The new comic update schedule will be Las Lindas -> Knighthood -> Las Lindas -> Knighthood. We are aiming for 3 to 4 updates a month, just like before. I am charging by comic page and not by month so I can have some flexibility with my workload and schedule. The reward streams, Ask the High Prime and Illustrations will remain on their usual schedules. We’ll all be feeling it out as we go. I might be back here soon to make some changes and new updates, but I hope you all will continue to support me and my work. Thanks so much! Milestones Unlocked @ $300 per comic page! I will periodically host a stream on my  Picarto page  that anyone can join. I'll randomly pick someone from the stream and do a small sketch for that person live! The number of sketches is usually around three or four per stream. The rules and themes will be posted before each stream. I will only announce streams in the months I can update comics. Unlocked @ $600 per comic page!   Ask The High Prime is a NSFW blog where you can ask Ambar, the super sexy world leader of Las Lindas, and lots of other Las Lindas and Knighthood characters whatever you want. Ambar is fun-loving and very playful with the answers, so while they're kiiiiinda true, they're mostly over-the-top fun. I used to use Tumblr for this. You can find it  here ! But I also use my  twitter  and this Patreon feed for updates. I will only update Ask the High Prime in the months I can update comics. Unlocked @ $900 per comic page! Can't get enough of the world of Las Lindas and Knighthood? Now patrons can have the chance to vote for a special illustration every month, that will explore the secret life of the characters or just have fun putting them in funny and often sexy situations."},

With tumblr in disarray and my instagram shadow banned it is more difficult than ever to develop a following. I'm hoping Patreon will allow me to continue working. This Patreon page is for figure artists that are interested in figure studies and also for comic, pin-up and fantasy style artists. I will be posting roughly once a week with 16 to 18 images a month for figure artists and 18 to 20 for fantasy and pinup artists. Most of the images here are posted several months before social media posts.The photos here will also be at a higher resolution of 2400 to 3000 pixels and not 800 like on tumblr or deviant art. Most images are of the nude figure so you must be 18 years of age or above to join. Drawing and painting from these images will help you become a better artist. You will be billed by patreon when you signup and then the date you signed up of the month thereafter. So if you joined on the 12th of the month you will be billed by patreon on the 12th of the next month. \nPatrons will be able to download images to use now or later. How to use this site.   I do not shoot stock photos. I shoot reference photos for artists. This is not the site for you if you are looking for a specific pose, there are tons of those sites on the web. I shoot with an eye for form, lighting and beauty.This site is for artists looking to improve their drawing ability and also looking for inspiration. I hope you will consider joining. \n  Where will the funds received go? \n A good model's rate can be from $300 to $400 for a photo session. It is especially hard to find ones without tattoos. With the cost of studio rental, props,costumes and copyright fees a shoot usually runs about $500 to $600.The funds received here will allow me to shoot more often and maintain the high level of quality for images and not go broke in the process. My goal here is to have this patreon site enable me to keep working and be able to quit one of my part time jobs. All models are over 18 years of age and signed a model's release. I copyright all images. I believe in paying models and artists for their work. \n  Terms of use. \n All content here will be specific to Patreon and only for members that are patrons. Use of photos is for Personal use only and not to be shared or posted anywhere else. You can of course post your artwork and sell original art that you create using our reference just no prints, book covers,posters etc. If you do need a license,one can be had for a small fee just let me know. \n  Thanks! \n  I strive to create images that make you want to draw or paint! \n Xeno"},

Hi, I’m Bob, the creator of  Demon of the Underground ! \n I've been working on DOTU and other projects in the Underground universe for years, and I want more than anything to \nkeep working on them! With the support of my patrons, I was able to \nhave some of my comic work funded for the first time.   Since launching, we've gone from 26 patrons to 300+ patrons! Thanks to reader support, I was even able to launch  Devoted: Merritt's Story , \n a  Patreon exclusive  written novel series that's become more popular with DOTU \nreaders (and even some non-DOTU readers) than I could have dreamed!  Belmont is officially the first DOTU/Merritt's Story character to have his own fan club. ;) And in 2022, I created Cooking with Belmont, a super fun visual novel showing the lighter side of the underground! Due to rising living expenses and an internet climate that makes it much more difficult to get projects like mine in front of people who might like it, I need the help of patrons more than ever.  In recent years, I've had to spend more time on freelance and less on personal projects, but I'd love to turn that back around! DOTU and its related stories are crowdfunded projects that depends on reader support.  With enough patrons, I can make these stories the focus of my career and bring you even more art and adventures! I am hugely grateful for every single patron who joins my campaign!  My patrons are the core of my DOTU community.   We share laughs.  We chat on Patreon and Discord about characters and deconstruct plot elements.  My patrons are always the first to know what plans are coming, and oftentimes they help me by making suggestions and requests for features and bonuses I'm considering.  I always look forward to hearing what they have to say.  And I'd consider it an honor to have you as part of the group. Ready to join?   Pledge now and pick your tier ! Still have questions?   Check out my Patreon FAQ   and my  Merritt's Story info page , or shoot me a private message, and I'll be happy to help!"},

For $5+ a month , you'll be able to see work-in-progress posts of everything I'm doing (which usually means you'll see something almost a month before everyone else)! Lastly, for $10+ a month , you'll get your name as a special thanks at the start of my flash animations, as well as at the end of any videos. There's not a whole lot else I can provide at this level, so it's more so just if you really enjoy my work and would like to contribute more~ ❤ ________________________________________ Patron Polls Every month, I'll round up a couple ideas or themes for what to draw that month, and everyone in $3+ tiers will get to vote on their favorite. Highly voted ideas from previous months will sometimes get thrown back into a poll, or if two options are neck and neck, I'll try to combine the two! ________________________________________ WIP Posts There isn't a neatly defined schedule for WIP posts, but I try to include updates on 2 or more projects at a time. For illustrations, I'll also add in timelapse gifs so you can see the entire process up until that point! ________________________________________"},

I am mostly known from creating derivative art based on a well-known MMORPG, but I also have a large portfolio of original art and derivative art based off of other IPs.

So if you like my work and want to support me trying some different things, please consider becoming a patron.\n \n \nPatreon is not going to replace my commission work. There will still be opportunities for people to get custom artwork, and I believe that my normal commission work will benefit from this campaign, because of potential new things I try may become available for commissions.\n \n \n \n Goals \n \n \nThe main goal of the campaign was to create a colouring book and release pages monthly. Interest in colouring books for adults has risen over the last few years, and if normal colouring books for adults are popular, then I'm quite certain there's an interest in an \n adult  colouring book. Since the completion of the colouring book, the focus has shifted to provide high-quality sexy images monthly, plus stream Patron requested sketches. The new goal is to get back into comics and creating high-quality, fun and sexy comics for the internet to enjoy. \n \n \n Free content \n \n \nThe content supported through this campaign will be posted for free viewing on my normal sites like Hentai Foundry, Tumblr and Twitter. I have no intentions of putting it completely behind a paywall.\n \nThere will of course be perks for patrons, though. Patrons may receive high-res PSD versions of the colouring pages and higher resolution copies of other artwork produced, as well as seeing work in progress sketches.\n \n \nThanks for supporting me and my work!\n \n \n"},

I like making (but\nnot limited to) furry and tra nsformation comics  and art. \n\n\n  This Patreon supports  my aspiration to make  comics with a range of\ninterests for you fine people to enjoy, and to flex my creative\nmuscle s in ways that aren't always permitted when supporting myself\nwith regular monthly art commissions. I've been taking freelance\ncommissions for over 5 years, and supporting myself on them for more\nthan 2 years, so I want to take what I've learned and work on some\nlarger projects for a wider audience. While my schedule doesn't allow\nme to take the Gumroad route, working on and selling entire comics at\na time, I'd decided that instead  I would open myself up to my\naudience at large, and give them the options to get to know how I\nwork, as well as a say in what I work on next. \n\n\n \nI've MANY ideas stored up over the years, and I'm very excited to\nshare them with the  wonderful people who would allow me to learn and\nearn through Patreon as a medium. Ultimately, I intend to improve my\nskills  not only for myself, but  for those of you who are always\nexcited to ask for work from me. \n\n\n \nSo thank you all for supporting me so far, and I'll do my best to\nhave earned it. \n\n Patreon Suggestion Box!  “ So\nhow does  this thing work?” \n\nFirst off, the majority of the content posted here is not safe for work, and  is appropriate for a mature audience.  \n\n \nBesides that it's very simple. Rather than holding comics behind a\nproverbial pay-wall, I will be allowing supporters to view comics a\nweek ahead of their public release, on top of other goodies on Fridays. As such, my Patreon will be on a\n Per Update  basis for comic pages, and I will do up to 4 paid\nposts a month on average, never more than that. \n\nSo, that means pledging $1 per update means that you pat $4 at the\nend of the month. Should you choose to  pledge to 1 or 2 paid posts a\nmonth, then you only get the rewards for those by adjusting the limit\non your pledge. \n\nIf you're charged and Patreon makes a charge from the previous weeks\nof that month, should that happen please PM me and I will send you\nthe rewards for the weeks you were charged for. \n\n\n “ What\nmilestones do you have lined up for us?” \n\nMy first big goal is to put out fresh comic content on a weekly\nbasis, and free little filler tidbits in here and there. After that I\nwant to lower the higher tier prices a little so I can make pages at\ncost, but cost LESS for the individual supporters! \n\n\n A\nclosing note \n\nPatreon gets many declined pledges at the end of each month through\nbad credit cards, empty Paypals, or through bots, so do please help me\nout so I can get as close to my estimated total as I can get. \n\n\n \nThank you all again for your support. \n"},

Their support and my urge to tell a story using what I learned these past years gave birth to  Acquainted , an episodic adult VN centering around mystery, romance, corruption, and storytelling. Chapter 1 is now out, check it out [ HERE ]. Grappling with the usual challenges of daily college life was supposed to be hard at times, but fun. At least that's what Lewis thought... That is, until his girlfriend broke up with him and his clingy roommate joined the same college as him while he's still trying to rebound and recover from the breakup. Handling all of those things and keeping up with classes might've been possible, but that changed when a mysterious girl from his dreams appeared.

Much like Source Filmmaker my goals are to familiarize myself with the mechanics of blender and progressively work on larger content. I am already familiar with animation work in general so making that next set will not be difficult. With your help I can make every production \nbigger and better! If you would like a sample of my previous works please check my  twitter page. Why Patreon? Before I \nstarted this patreon I only used a limited amount of my spare time to \ncreate my works due to work and other commitments. However, I can easily\n spent 8-12 hours to create the highest quality content for you to \nenjoy. I love animating and feel deeply passionate about it, it's \nbecause of this I think I could really give you your money's worth. Whenever\n I animate I always have the highest quality for details in mind and \nwhile this takes extra time I believe its worth it. To capture that \ncinematic feeling every detail is important when animating a scene and I\n intent to put that much work into every production. With your \ngenerosity I will work hard to bring you the most premium quality \nanimations. Any \nsupport will be greatly appreciated since it helps cover the costs of \nseveral of my upkeep, voice acting and other investments that will go \ntowards animation. It also motivates me to continue to bring you more content in super high quality.

And welcome to my place here on Patreon.   I really hope that you'll enjoy what you'll find here.  \n \nNow the big question:  Why Patreon?   Over the past years I`ve been dedicating most of my time to do commissions to help with my work's income but that never left me enough time to work more often in more complex projects like new comics and animations with my own characters and that`s something that I really want to change. \nAs you already know, producing comics or animations demands a massive amount of time and work so your support here will hopefully give me the chance to focus my efforts to create more projects like that. \n \nSo what`s next?  \nMaybe you already know  OVERTIME , my first comic project published some years ago. \nWorking in something like that was an extremely challenging and fun experience that I was only able to repeat once with my other comic  STRIP BRAWLERS  but time and work schedules made it impossible for me to continue doing this kind of things until now. During the past year, your support helped me to create my third comic, OVERTIME 2 HARDWORKERS, my third comic that was completed during the past month and now it's time to finally see what comes next.  This time I decided to try something a bit different so the next project that you'll be seeing here from now on will be a visual novel called  STORIES FROM THE HOUSE OF BEEF . Since I never tried to do something like this before, and programming isn't one of my strongest skills, for this project I'll be having the help of Wolfstar,  (creator of Sins and Paradise), a good and talented friend that will be using his coding magic to bring this baby to life. And I also have to thank DyneWulf, creator of Extracurricular Activities for his help as well. And in case you haven't seen the great works they're doing here are their links so you visit their sites. \n Wolfstar Patreon Dynewulf's Patreon Thank you very much once again for taking the time to read this and if you like my works enough to decide to support me you`ll have my deepest thanks and my best efforts to produce the best contents I can."},

As you may know, I make furry erotic art but I mainly draw mature hunky older characters. I love drawing these types of characters and built a following because of it and have so many ideas for stories and characters to explore. I have been drawing furry art since I was young and fully committed to it and am able to make money because of it. I hope you're ready for what's in store! Why Patreon? To get by I would take on commissions and I've been doing that for years as work in my country is pretty scarce. Until recently, I could not collect payments from commissions due to a restriction on my method in my country by the government and banking institutions here, but that's a long situation to explain. By using Patreon, you can choose the tier that fits your budget and the rewards accordingly. With your support, I can keep making more drawings while supporting myself and my family financially.  What to expect? Notice You are charged upfront as soon as you pledge from any tier. Most of the content they will be posted will be pornographic and any and all contents depicted will be  adults age 18 and up  with the main theme being  gay, hairy, hunky, older men with occasional bi and straight themes . Illustrations will be posted here first for patrons to enjoy a month before posting publicly on my other galleries and social media. For the exception of my weekly free comic series, where the WIPs would be exclusive for patrons, monthly comic pages will be posted at least twice a month for patrons and then a month later to the public (If my schedule allows, the comics may become weekly for patrons). You will be able to vote on suggested themes and comic stories in the  $6  and  higher tiers. Thank you for reading and I greatly appreciate your support! :)"},

So I finally decided to take my writing a lot more seriously, so that's why I started this Patreon page!  The idea behind my Patreon is simple. To provide high-quality furry art backed up by pornographic stories for the fandom with the help of great artists! I know it's a hell of a stretch to do this, but I wanted to try it anyway, I thought long and hard about this and put in a lot of effort constructing the page and choosing all the different tiers with a multitude of rewards. By supporting me not only are you helping me create new worlds and scenes, but you also can put yourself into those worlds and scenes! You can suggest ideas and vote on them through polls. Your idea could be next!  I am also interested in developing a comic series down the line, full of fun and smutty adventures! And if this Patreon page takes off, a visual novel that you can play with a bunch of fun and smutty adventures, too! :D I am to post here at least once or twice a month, and with your help, that number can grow! Any sort of support is greatly appreciated, even if you do not pledge and just share that is greatly appreciated! There's also a bunch of nice Discord roles included with the tiers if you're into that kind of thing. C: Thank you for checking out my page!

Where are my rewards? A :  I will send the rewards to you through private messages once I received the confimation email about your pledge! Usually it took me around 10-30 minutes, but if and when I got otherwise occupied (or asleep), it usually takes a few more hours. But never worry, your rewards will reach you! Q : I opened the link to the rewards and the new pictures aren't there, what happened? A :  Refresh the page or app, or close and reopen the app. ;) Q : Hey can I have like, your rewards from many many many months ago? A :  I am so sorry, this used to be the case, but ever since I had to change the delivery method of my rewards, I had to change the overall availability of my works.

If you're interested, I would love to entertain you with the stuff I draw.  I’m not the fastest artist but I try to update as frequently as I can without compromising art quality! With the funds of Patreon, I`ll be doing stuff like original art, fan art pinups and all things listed on the current goal! Instead of a boss that begrudgingly hands me a paycheck every week, I have you, The Patrons, to help me keep going.   Now, A bit of history here:  Two years ago this patreon was only funcioning as a tip jar, on which content in a systematic and recurrent way wasn't always guaranteed.  But it is now being constantly updated with the new paid content and since Oct 2021 changes are being made; Previous contents are a bit different from the whole picture of what's going to come.  With all that I am doing, I try to be an octopus of a person and so far it's working even with the difficulties, but Patreon has to slow down since I don't want to delay illustrations anymore as it had been happening a few times. I usually don't open about personal life, and who doesn't have problems, right?  My other work is a few alternative therapies and they demand a lot of time to be made well. And my studies, that are the studies of my life - they are not work yet but hopefully soon! That is Fungi cultivation and research here in Brasil. So this is a turning point to me and I'm happy to have you all here doing so much to my tiny self and art with your support, all kinds of them;  This may be disappointing to some and I'm really sorry if I have disappointed any of you because of the changes, and I if I did - I understand you. And I still appreciate every single on of you.   It's hard to leave the secure way of doing things when you're a freelancer artist, But for my art, my other work sake and my own, with all the support you guys show and give me, I felt strong enough to do it. Last but not least,  I'd like to thank everyone who has supported me in any shape or form, not just financially, It means a lot to have been told all your kind words about my work, and that you people love what I do regardless of content. This helps me keep going, to create and be loving towards what I do when things are not easy. Thank you for all of it!!! You are wonderful humans!!! And I hope you enjoy this patreon as much as you expected or even more! Ps.: Soon I also plan on providing an option for art prints!  How does this all work? Is this a subscription service? Patreon is a system very much like Kickstarter, where people can come to post projects and creations in hopes that they can accrue financial backing and such. The difference is that a creators Patreon works as an on-going campaign. If you pledge x amount, that money will be sent to the creator every week/month/update! My campaign is set to “Per Month”, so you are only charged once at the end of every month."},

You are a 24-year-old male graduate student studying Archaeology at modern-day Miskatonic University. Being the perfect student, you are on the road to achieve your dreams and with your whole life ahead of you. All of that begins to change when a mysterious artifact is discovered outside of Dunwich. Do you have what it takes to transform your school into your own personal harem while avoiding suspicion, and bring about a lustful apocalypse? In  Artifact , you must spend your time wisely, as you only have one school year to stealthily turn the entire campus into your sex-crazed bimbo sluts without being caught by a mysterious rival who's on the hunt for you. There are branching decision trees, you will need to make wise decisions if you are to be successful. You will have to avoid suspicion during all of this, as engaging in risky behavior can get you one step closer to being caught. However, with great risk comes great reward! At its core,  Artifact  caters to the following fetishes:  breast/body  inflation,  bimbofication, and  mind control . There are also optional fetishes which include:  femdom (on yourself),  futanari  (others),  parasitism  (others),  impregnation  (others),  exhibitionism  (yourself and others),  gender swapping  (others) ,  forced feminization  (on yourself or others),  small penis humiliation  (yourself or others),  big dick  (is this a category?) A lot of these optional fetishes are only 'optional' in the same way that getting hit by a koopa in Mario is optional (an unintended consequence of your actions), or that getting a fire flower is optional (a powerup that can greatly help, but is not required to win). Artifact  is currently in  alpha,  and is  early access.  There will be over  20 unique characters  (about a 2:5 male-to-female ratio) and  over 90 possible sex scenes .  Q: Why Early Access? A:  “I would like the game to have fanbase input early in the development process to help curate a game that both fun and fulfilling. Feedback is highly valuable. I hope to make something that surpasses expectations from players, for the average adult game.” Q: Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access? A:  “The game will be in Early Access for approximately 1-2 years.” Q: How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version? A:  “I plan to add a lot more original artwork and music, plus finish out the story, add a whole new act after the ending, expand the mind control and possession mechanics, more feminization and sissification mechanics, additional character interactions with more avenues for seduction, gender swapping for the player character, cleaner formatting, and stat rebalancing.” Q: What is the current state of the Early Access version? A:  “You can travel around the campus seducing staff and students with supernatural powers, infect people with parasitic worms, lower their intelligence, dynamically change the size of genitalia, send them into a sex frenzy, and utilize their skills or connections to help take over the university! You can possess randomly-generated students and use them to further your goals. There are branching decision trees, various upgrades to boost your powers, encounters, and quests.” Q: Will the game be priced differently during and after Early Access? A:  “No.” Q: How are you planning on involving the Community in your development process? A:  “I am counting on community feedback to make the best game possible. I receive notifications whenever there are new posts in the forums and do my best to respond in a timely manner. I am very excited to see the community that will grow!”"},

A lot of its is creating art of stuff I like such as Giant robots, monsters, anime, sci fi, the occasional SSBBW or anything that peaks my interests. When I'm not working my day job, I tend to do fan art of said things and try to develop some of my own concepts and designs for my own personal projects.  What I plan to do is to treat my account more as a tip jar for those who are interested and it hopefully won't take too much out of your finances.  For just $1 a month you will gain immediate access to the my art as it is being made. You will get to see the final product before it gets posted to DeviantART and Twitter, exclusive content like WIP sketches and more.   For $3 a month you'll be able to participate in monthly polls to decide what I should draw next. Something to keep in mind is that the availability of my time depends on my day job situation. I might not always be free or able to produce art at all times. This is set up in a way that I am able to post without stressing myself out too much. This Patreon takes upfront payment.  Please be aware of this if you are  pledging near the end of the month. Thank you for your consideration! "},

(Some work that I am super proud of will be released publicly after a minimum of being up for 4 to 5 months, but large majority will remain exclusive.) Access to high resolution PNGs of my artwork in the resolution I work on them. (open to suggestions on which artwork you want the full resolutions to.) For images that were made in low resolution and upscaled for posting online, images that don't have a high resolution version basically. I will be posting the PSDs for these images in place of HD PNGs. Still brainstorming more benefits for the future so keep a look out for that.

I'm IWillSunder, a person that happened to enjoy drawing big girls, you might heard of me on DeviantArt and Twitter where I usually post my stuff :) WHAT I DO~ :O I like to draw size stuff varying from a wholesome cute size interactions to a big lewd destructive giantesses, having a little walk through cities and eating tinies... depends on the mood ^w^ Sometimes I do normie stuff. Usually I do normal one panel arts and comic style arts( colored and monochrome). BENEFITS AND CONCLUSION~ ^^ Since I launch it fairly early, I don't expect a big amount of peeps to join me here, but I still want to give at least some benefits to those who are willing to support me. For my patreons ,  you guys will have an earlier access to my works, sketches and a big thanksu :>  I'll also provide with comics that will have extra panels on patreon ;) Future benefits, If there will be a decent amount of followers( I dunno like 10 lol), I'll make a discord server for ya. I feel like most of you are modern epic gamers have one on your desktop or device. You will always be notified when I publish new stuff, will have a great opportunity to discuss my stuff in the chat, and have polls! I'm really indecisive in most of the stuff I draw, so don't worry there will be probably plenty of polls. Rhea's hangaout events, This benefit is still under thinking process (dunno how to execute it). Overall Idea is to make either art or really short comics with one of the supporters each month. It could be a short size interaction between Rhea and your oc( if u dont have one, we can make some). Please understand that if this benefit will be available, there will be certain rules to follow. That's gonna be it for the start, but we might change that in the future! As for my self ,  can't say I haven't been dreaming to live a life by just drawin big girls eating little peeps, but with patreon support you guys can make this dream come true.

(+18) Hi, pleased to meet you. I'm  Pikajota , from Spain. ^^ Before supporting me, you should know that I am not living thanks to this, so I do not have as much time to draw as other artists who only work as illustrators. I want to be honest with all of you and I would not like to disappoint you. On the other hand, I am striving every week to bring you all the possible content, with sketches, illustrations and polls with ideas that you contribute. So please, feel free to support me as much as you wish, enjoy my page and thank you very much for your constant support! ^^ What will you find on this page? I guess you'll know what kind of things I like to draw: I love to draw fictional creatures, mainly feral. You will see basically adult content with humans and fantasy and fictional creatures. What I do not like to draw? -Unfortunately I do not feel comfortable drawing homosexual content. -I will not draw real animals or anything that may contain animal abuse or zoophilia. Everything I draw will be with creatures that do not exist in the real world. Apologize for the inconvenience. -I do not usually draw more unusual fetish like vore, etc, but if you have doubts, feel free to ask. I hope to continue growing and perfecting my art thanks to you. Thank you very much for your interest!  You can see my gallery and my previous drawings here: Furaffinity http://www.furaffinity.net/user/pikajota/"},
