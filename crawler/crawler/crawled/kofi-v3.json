Here is the Youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/CraftingwithApril. \nMy Design Space files are created from Access images.  I use Design Space Cricut Access images for elements of many designs, but I try to use free shapes for base elements so you can change things out if you don't have an Access subscription. I encourage Access because it is an excellent library of images and shapes.  If you do not have an Access subscription, you will have to purchase those elements or swap them out in the file for something else - you can do this with many of them. Not all images can be changed if an image was used to create a shaped edge; for instance, I sliced something using it. You can not avoid purchasing that image if you do not have Access & you can't change it; those are not very common, but they occur on some older files. \n\nI am a Crafter & A Cricut ®Product Expert. I love crafting! I am not a professional spokesperson, photographer or videographer, or marketer.  I am a crafter just like you!\n\nI love sharing my files, ideas, videos, and vast crafting knowledge with you.\n\nIf Cricut supplies me with a product or machine, I will always let you know that information. You will get my honest opinions. I love Cricut; even if I find that I am not successful with a product, I will encourage you to try it for yourself and make an informed decision about it; you may have better luck than me with a particular item/items and as always all new products have a learning curve, don't write off a material you haven't tried based on someone else's opinion of it, it takes practice to learn how to work with a product to find the best technique to use for it.\n\nI genuinely appreciate your patronage; thank you! Your support and generosity inspire me, and you sincerely appreciate that. I could not do this without you!\n\nYou can also help support me by using my links to shop, and they earn me a small commission if you purchase after clicking the link but in no way cost you anything extra.
