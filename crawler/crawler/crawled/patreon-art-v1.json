It's a great piece of software !\n\t\tWe only quite recently started to play DnD again, remembering how good it was back in high school ! We're both DMing and playing in each other's campaigns, based on Exandria (Matthew Mercer's Critical Role Tal'Dorei and Wildemount settings !)\n\t \n\tA bit less time to play right now as we're still in the beginning of our Patreon campaign and we're still discovering and learning from our mistakes.\n\t\tI'm sure we'll find a good rhythm once settled in ! ü§û\n\t \n \n \n \n How does our Patreon work ? \n \n \n\tWe charge 'per release'. \n\t\tIt means that when we release a post containing assets for our patrons, you get charged the pledge amount in accordance to the tier you decided to pledge for.\n\t\tIf we release a second post within the same month, you only get charged if the maximum pledge you set is above your initial pledge.\n\t\tMoreover, \n\t if we don't release anything  for one month, for any reason at all,  you do not spend anything. \n\t \n\tTransparency is key for us to build a trust relationship with you.\n\t\tIt's only fair that we need to create stuff for you to support us !\n\t\tWe have to create and release posts to make some money and you spend however much you want or are comfortable with at any point in time.\n\t\tYou can change your tier, change your maximum pledge or even cancel your pledge and rejoin us \n\t at any moment .\n\t\tPatreon charges all members on the \n\t first of each month  (for the content released the month before)\n\t\tMore info can be found \n\t here \n\t We want to keep a high quality standard for our assets. Therefore, It is highly unlikely that we will ever release more than four paid posts per month.\n\t\tWe estimate our frequency of releases to stay between two and four per month depending on how inspired or otherwise busy we are !\n\t\tWe love making these assets and are overwhelmed with the support our patrons have shown us already !\n\t\tOur ultimate goal would be to pay our bills by continuing to create animations that you all enjoy !\n\t \n \n \n \n Do you need a Virtual Tabletop to make use of your assets ? \n \n\tNot necessarly I suppose ! \n\t\tThe animations we create are video files using the webm format.\n\t\tIt is a popular format designed for the web that is light in size and is now compatible with most internet browsers, even Edge ! (Safari doesn't...yet and of course not Internet Explorer ) üòÅ\n\t\tIf you're curious about this format you can read more \n\t here \n\t \n \n \n \n What Virtual Tabletop can I use these animations with ? \n \n\tWebm video files are compatible with Foundry VTT, Roll 20, Astral Tabletop.\n\t\tFantasy Ground still doesn't support the Webm format though, unfortunately üòï\n\t \n\tWe will try and provide support as well to other VTTs. However it is easier for us to debug on Foundry VTT as we know it better and use it for our sessions.\n\t \n\tDon't hesitate to reach us here or on our \n\t Discord  if you encounter any problem.\n\t \n \n \n \n How to access our content ? \n \n\t \n\t \n\t\tFor the free stuff :\n\t \n\t \n\tFor FoundryVTT users : Install and activate a module called \"JB2A - Jules&Ben's Animated Assets\" within Foundry itself. more info¬† here \n\tFor other users, you can download the files on \n\t Github \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t\tFor the 'patron-locked' content :\n\t \n\t \n\tWhen you pledge, you have access to all Patreon locked content.\n\t\tLook at the bottom of the latest Patreon post and you'll find the link to itch.io where you can enter your Patreon details and download the file there.\n\t\tIt's the easiest way to overcome the 200MB limit imposed by Patreon we have found.\n\t \n\tFor \n\t Forge  users, you can access it straight from \" The Bazaar \"¬†as a premium module.\n\t\tMake sure you have uninstalled the free version of our module first.\n\t \n \n \n \n How do our assets work ? \n \n\t\tFor continuous effects, we made sure the videos seamlessly loop at 24 frames per second.\n\t \n\t\tFor instantaneous effects, we chose a more flexible framerate at 30 FPS, generally.\n\t \n \n \n \n How did we decide to create animated assets ? \n \n\tWe looked online for a way to play DnD online with friends who are all scattered around the world.\n\t\tThe best solution in our opinion was Foundry VTT. \n\t \n\tAtropos, the creator of Foundry VTT, has worked really hard in a short amount of time to create such a cool program !\n\t\tAnd it's getting better every day !\n\t \n\t\tThe more we played and engaged with the community on Discord and reddit, the more we wanted to give back to this awesome community. \n\t\tSo we decided to commit, put our knowledge to good use and create animated assets to help DMs around the world to track spell effects in a virtual table top's environment and make it look cool in the process !\n\t\tWe released our first batch for free on the foundry VTT Discord and on reddit, and the response has been very positive !\n\t \n\tWith the help of our first patrons and a few members of the Foundry VTT Discord server, we've broaden the way our assets are utilized and tinkered with instantaneous visual effects as well since it was sought after.\n\t\tThe results are very promising !\n\t\tWe're toying with a couple of other ideas as well ...\n\t \n\t \n\tYou can watch a tutorial on how to get started with our assets within Foundry VTT \n\t here \n\t \n\tFor Forge users, you can access it straight from the \n\t Bazaar  as a premium module.\n\t\tMake sure you have uninstalled the free version of our module first.\n\t \n \n \n \n Join us on Discord here : \n \n \n \nHere is our \n Github page  with our latest  free release \n \n Copyright : \n \n\tAll the content is registered under the Creative Commons License Attribution-NonCommercial CC BY-NC-SA.

Sure, that quote may have been said by someone during their final detachment with reality, but I‚Äôve come to terms with that. I‚Äôve been a YouTuber for over a decade, reality and I don‚Äôt even share passing glances anymore. Here‚Äôs the deal. I don‚Äôt want to open Fifa lootboxes, fake reactions to other people reacting to things, or fight Logan Paul. This means that my avenues of generating revenue from my online comedy shenanigans are few and far between. I mean I could try sponsorships, but I‚Äôm pretty sure that you‚Äôre all one person explaining how a VPN works away from snapping and killing everything in a one mile radius. I know I am. So, here‚Äôs the compromise. Patreon, a place where people who like our things pay us to keep doing them. Us?! Yes! There‚Äôs Matt, who runs all the confusing business stuff, Rebecca, who does all the art and works on the [REDACTED] projects, and my Dad, who films himself every day, mostly complaining about the rain. Thanks to this very Patreon, four folk get to eat food, pay rent, and spend 90% of all of our money on the most expensive thing in the universe, train tickets. So, aside from the warm feeling of functioning commerce, what else do you get when throwing money at me?

Also, get ahead of the game with my upcoming projects. First dibs on any potential crowdfunding/merch releases/whatever that we end up doing! My first book was almost entirely funded by Patreons before the world knew about it! That was an accident, but now it‚Äôs a feature! Exclusive stuff!

YouTube will remain ad free, Twitch won‚Äôt have ad breaks, and you‚Äôll never have to hear me talk about how you can watch foreign Netflix if you pay a company loads of money a month. Everyone‚Äôs a winner! But that‚Äôs not all! It used to be all, but we‚Äôve changed it! On top of all of that we now have a few extra special tiers that will get you cool things for a few bob more. Things like‚Ä¶ Your name in the credits of videos! A Discord that I‚Äôll be posting pictures of my dogs to! Signed, physical rewards!

GUILDS (beta)  is a tabletop miniatures skirmish wargame set in an intriguing arcane world called Mundus, a place inhabited by mythic creatures and scoured by warfare. You take the role of a Guildmaster, a cunning or resolute leader of a rising Guild. As you build your Guildhall, you‚Äôll recruit Infantry warriors, mounted cavalry units, and fearsome beasts. It‚Äôs up to you to lead your warband to face grueling battles against rival guilds, epic monstrosities and other sinister forces. Throughout a Campaign, you‚Äôll embark on Quests to compete with other guilds for spoils and treasure. Each skirmish risks defeat and setback, but also the opportunity to seize unique relics and gain new powers. As your renown grows and the influence of your guild spreads, you‚Äôll have the chance to attract Arcanists, Epic Heroes, and even Legendary Beasts to your cause Five powerful forces seek to conquer Mundus and bring the realm under their sway. Will your guild stand against the tide of Chaos and Corruption in the name of Order and Fortitude, or will the Wild grow resurgent? You and your guild may very well be the ones to tip the scales in the conflict for the fate of Mundus.GUILDS Rulebook0.802 is available to download in the Attachment!

A little over 11 years ago, I registered the web site¬† ForgottenWeapons.com  and created my first online repository of firearms information. It was a pretty small site at that time, with mostly archival photos from the Aberdeen Proving Grounds.¬† About 10 years ago, I took the next step and relaunched the site as a regularly-updated blog. This then became a more significant endeavor, posting new content 5 days/week. From the beginning, the focus has been on rare and unusual firearms, the more mechanically diverse the better. I have touched on common guns as well intermittently, as it is essential to have an understanding of the common guns in order to understand the development that went into them and their offshoots.¬† The content I maintain includes a wide spectrum of media:  Written articles Detailed photographs Original manuals Trials reports and other primary-source documents Video showing disassembly and function Video showing practical competition use My private goal from the very beginning of this project has been to create a comprehensive encyclopedia of firearms development. That is such a Quixotic goal that I don't generally mention it, but the project has grown so far beyond any of my expectations in the past years that my impossible goal looks a bit less impossible these days. It is still a lifetime's work at least, but I can't imagine anything I would rather be doing.¬† Dollars, Clams, Onions, Bucks, Dubloons, and Greenbacks Of course, it takes money to do. From basic things like paying for food and rent and insurance to supplying obscure ammunition for shooting to the much more significant costs of traveling to the museums and private collections where the rare and unique guns are housed. Thus far, I have funded my work with video advertisements on YouTube and Full30, and with the help of a couple sponsoring companies. However, my work is distinct from the vast majority of firearms media in that I rarely look at guns which are actually in production - and that really limits the possibility of finding corporate sponsors. On the other hand, that limitation is also a blessing in disguise as it prevents me from coming under the editorial control of any corporate overlord. On those occasions when I do discuss modern guns, I can say the truth as I see it without looking over my shoulder and worrying about the consequences of not properly buttering up any company. I cherish that independence, and I will not give it up. So what is the best way to fund an endeavor like Forgotten Weapons in today's world? Advertising has been the standard answer for a long time, largely because of simple carryover from places like television and print media. The Internet changes things, however. The Internet allows us to find any information we like without the overhead of printing presses or a finite number of cable channels. The potential audience for any information is unlimited, and that offers the prospect of sustainable micropayments. Having our daily lives flooded with advertisements is not a good thing, it's just the system we are most acclimated to. I think that a tiny amount of support from a huge number of people is a far better system, and Patreon looks like a way to achieve that model.¬† My Proposal From the very first HTML web site, I have had a policy that there will never be a paywall in front of Forgotten Weapons. First and foremost, my goal is to create a public archive of this information, and a paywall is anathema to that.¬† If you enjoy what I am creating and curating at Forgotten Weapons, this is a way you can contribute a buck a month to ensure that it keeps happening. If you want to contribute more that's wonderful - but a buck a month is all I am asking for. If there are enough people who find value in the work, that will be plenty sufficient to keep it alive and vibrant. Most Patreon creators offer a handful of different perks to entice people to donate more, and these usually entail special and exclusive content. I am not doing that, for two main reasons. First, I don't want to make special content accessible only to people who have paid - that goes against the \"free and public\" foundation of the endeavor. Second, I want to focus my time on the guns and history which are the whole point of Forgotten Weapons, rather than devote time to what are basically marketing gimmicks. You came here (presumably) because you like what I am doing already, so more (and better!) of that is what I am offering you. The perks that I have are about access to my time directly, while the entirety of the content I produce will remain freely and fully accessible to everyone.", "amount_post": 1, "amount_subs": null, "price_tiers": [{"title": "Channel Support: Meetups, Q&A, Apocrypha", "monthly": "$3", "description": "At this level, you will get access to completely ad-free videos via Patreon email every time a new video publishes.

I learned to be part of a real team of dedicated individuals working tirelessly for a shared cause. I learned how to work with staff, volunteers, the public, and other sanctuary organizations to do the very best for both the animals in my care and the others out there still in danger. And most importantly, I learned the joy and heartbreak of opening my heart to animals in need, and I found my true passion in life. There are so many animals out there in need, but I will focus on one section of that population: pigs. I feel this is where I can do the most good. My experience with pig rescue, care, and advocacy will give me the confidence to do the best for them. I want to offer rescue support, a forever home for as many pigs as is possible, hospice care, and the opportunity to ease the suffering of others thru advocacy and education.        When this dream began to take shape, I went to look at a property with a friend. The property had been a small scale ‚Äùfarm to table‚Äù type facility. Pigs, goats and other smaller animals had been raised to go to slaughter at the frighteningly young age that most animals bred for food face. We saw some of the tools of the trade around the barn, and a chill went through me. The agent mentioned that there might be a pig still there; I insisted we find him immediately. That is when I meet Arthur, a beautiful 3 1/2 month old piglet. He came right to me, looking me in the face as if to ask my intentions. I knew it immediately.  ‚ÄúI am not leaving without this pig.\" The agent was confused, but after realizing I was completely serious, got the owner to agree to let me have him. I am very lucky to have friends who share my passion, so I had support and supplies on the way in minutes. When I called my friend Mike Stura from Skylands Rescue and Sanctuary to ask for a temporary home for Arthur he did not hesitate to say yes. So now Arthur, who was the last pig to be threatened with death at this place, will be the first pig to be offered sanctuary there. The place where Arthur was meant to die young and afraid will be the place where he learns to live, to love, and be loved in return. He will welcome new friends, he will be a teacher, he will get to be an old man, and finally, he will die in his own bed surrounded by people who love him.  This transformation will take a lot of work. I am up for the challenge, and I am lucky to have the support of experienced friends and connections in the sanctuary community to help me with this enormous task. But I need more. There is a huge amount of work to be done, and we cannot do it with passion alone. So can you help Arthur and me make our dream come true, for us and for all the others out there waiting for help?

Every patron gets immediate access to a growing list of long form videos that document the subtle techniques of Thailand, and some of the greatest fighters who ever fought. In joining you not only can study these videos, but you are supporting the continuing process of finding, filming and detailing these masters of technique. The suggested pledge is $5. Below is a more general introduction to me, my Muay Thai fighting, blogging and videography, and why I ask for your support. 10% of all all pledges  is added to my Kru Fund, sent to the krus and ex-fighters who have made my Muay Thai Library possible. ¬† Read about the Kru Fund here . I also add to the Kru Fund all net profits derived from the sale of my shorts and shirts:  www.8limbs.us/store for those who don't know me, this film short is a good introduction¬† The Things I Share and Think About After several years of writing out of pure passion I have transition to becoming a  professional  Muay Thai writer and to make my journalist efforts sustainable. Without this change my¬† 8limbsus.com  writing would have likely come to an end. I've needed to start writing for my readers. The response has been pretty incredible, and sponsors have stepped up in support - and at this point 8limbsus.com, all of my writing, filming and fighting has become sustainable through my patron pledges. Most know me already because you've been following me for a while now. For those that don't my background: I began blogging about 10 years ago, around the same time I started putting up videos of my training¬† on YouTube . My hope has always been to just share with others what I'm experiencing, and to pass on the contact I was having with my teachers. But the YouTube channel grew, as did my blogging, and I eventually saved up enough money to move to Thailand to train and fight full time. And I started a small website as a home for my blogging and shares: ¬†8limbsus.com .  I hit the ground running since I came to Thailand, and as you can see above I've pushed everything to the limit. I've fought 260+ times in that period (updated),  more in Thailand than any other westerner in history , man or woman. The entire time I've pushed myself to write and video share as much as I possibility could to help make things more clear, more imaginable for those back home. I know that before I came to Thailand there was very little I could find about what it is like to train and fight full time here, especially for women - I wanted to change that. And it may be fair to say that I've shared more in English on Muay Thai and Thai Muay Thai culture than anyone previously has, and hopefully I have inspired others to write and video share as well. The hope is that each fighter, each person, will put their story out there, create more ripples in the pond.¬† I've since expanded my Muay Thai writing to include a 2nd site devoted entirely to in-depth technique discussion and sharing:¬† sylviestudy.com . This was only accomplished through the support of my patrons, and it is a home for the concentrated study Thai legends and mental training observations. Adjunct to Sylvie Study is a new¬† Vimeo On Demand channel  that holds an Intensive Series, now 30 hours of training with single legends over multiple days. While the Muay Thai Library shows you a legendary kru or fighter in a single session, the Intensive series allows their style to unfold over many sessions, in some cases over 30. Historically there is no other documentation like this. Also, the On Demand set up allows me to raise money much more directly for the krus involved. They receive 55% of of the net profits of all On Demand sales, and get the chance to be supported by their knowledge directly. By tier, patrons can get promocodes for up to 15% discounts for these On Demand purchases.¬† Me as a Fighter - Making History Support me in Breaking the Unbreakable Record My incredible fight rate over these years has inspired me to take on the professional fighting record that has long thought to be untouchable: Boxer Len Wickwar's 470 documented fights, completed in 1947. This is going to take me the better part of 10 more years, but this is an enormous accomplishment to achieve, and I am asking everyone to cheer me on and life me up in it. You can read about that record and my attempt in my post:¬† Most Fights Ever: Chasing Len Wickar and the \"Untouchable\" Record.  This kind of record is so huge and would require so much support and endurance, it could only mean something on the larger scale of a community. I appreciate any support helping me get there, from cheering me on #ChasingLen to becoming a patron. Aside from the unbreakable Len Wickwar record, my other impossible goals include fighting for Olympic Gold, and eventually winning a Lumpinee belt (currently barred from women). You can¬† read about those goals here . What Do I Create? Aside from fighting and training like crazy on 8limbs.us I've liked to write about the¬† history of Muay Thai , and cover the female Muay Thai fighting scene in Thailand closely. I'm interested in contemporary Muay Thai gym culture, and¬† how western women fit in it . I share a lot of my training experiences, and¬† technical tips  that I have discovered from my various instructors, or that I have improvised. I vlog often. I also have been, in a larger sense¬† a reporter and advocate of female Thai fighters in Thailand . Those that have¬† subscribed to my blog  have receive a stream of varied information from Thailand over a 1,200 articles published since 2012. More than 50,000 follow my video content on¬† my YouTube channel  which has been documenting my training since the early days in Master K's basement (now more than 3,400 videos posted).¬†It has been a full time job, but a labor of love. Some of¬† my best posts can be found here .¬†If you haven't,  you can subscribe to my blog posts  here.¬† This isn't even to mention the exciting work I'm doing on¬† sylviestudy.com With patron help I've created the¬† Muay Thai Roundtable forum , the best deep discussion Muay Thai space on the Internet. For patrons in particular, beyond everything else, I've saved the best. I've created exclusive article and feature content. Here is a Table of Contents for the exclusive material patrons only can access:¬† Table of Contents - Exclusive material  - there are magazine level articles, diary entries, behind the scenes footage and interviews, burnout workouts, updates on my diet and nutrition, fight footage with my commentary, in-depth breakdown analysis of video with legends, and translated interviews with great fighters of Thailand's past. This is all in addition to the¬† Muay Thai Library itself , which is the foremost digital archive of Thai techniques available, anywhere, which patrons have access to. There is a huge amount of exclusive content for my patrons. Among all else I've also¬†established a Muay Thai internet forum: The¬† Muay Thai Roundtable . This is a one of a kind internet space, designed for the sharing of knowledge, far from the argument-driven sites that are more common in the fighting arts. In fact, the forum also has a Women Only section where women can find fellow female athletes to turn to for support or as knowledge sources, as women often can find themselves isolated in gym spaces.¬† And Last But Not Least , aside from supporting me as a fighter and a writer, you are supporting the filming of my¬† Muay Thai Library documentary project . This is the most comprehensive long form documentation of Muay Thai technique effort in history. The aim is to film at least 250 hours with over 150 krus and ex-fighters, as they teach their Muay, each completed with audio commentary to make explicit many subtle things that might be hidden from viewers. Unlike many documentary projects this one allows you to see the Library in progress, as each session is published. Patron pledges make this project possible as I search out legends and lessor known krus across Thailand, hopefully preserving not only their techniques, many of them at the edge of being lost, but also the energies of these men who have given themselves to Muay Thai. ¬†10% of all pledges go into my¬† Kru Fund . There are also several long term plans for books in the works, including a female fighter's guide for women in Thailand, and perhaps my personal story as well. Why Support My Content? This answer is simple. Support it because you value it. I have made it for the last several opening years free of charge, really just for the joy of it. ¬†And I have benefited immensely from the connections to people I've made around the world through the sharing. I've come upon rough times, and the reality is that without support I very well may have to stop producing what I write and film. If it is meaningful to you to help give me a leg up to help make sure it continues and expands, I appreciate the aid to no end. staying touch as a patron: Subscribe to my Sylvie Study website:  www.bit.ly/sylvie-study Subscribe to my 8limbsus website:  www.bit.ly/sylvie-8limbsus Subscribe to my YouTube Channel:  www.bit.ly/sylvie-youtube Join the Muay Thai Roundtable Forum:¬† https://8limbsus.com/muay-thai-forum/ photo credit above:¬† Warriors of the Mongkon If you would prefer to donate and support directly with Bitcoin, you can do so with this address:¬†1BhaVE4A1uBTPnw5V6TWtGnHRT5E41cHSF", "amount_post": 267, "amount_subs": 1, "price_tiers": [{"title": "Patron Supporter - Minimum", "monthly": "$1", "description": "The suggested pledge is $5, but as little as $1 will get you access to some of the very best of Patreon support.¬† \n \n * You will have immediate access to the 5 most recent entries of the \"Preserve the Legacy\" Muay Thai Library documentary project.

I'm a freelancer, writer, \"media artist,\" and video essayist. You might know me best from YouTube videos such as  This Is Phil Fish: A Case Study in Internet Fame ,  Things of Beauty: Super Smash Bros. as Spectator Sport , and  Why Are You So Angry? , a six part series about angry gamers and harassment. These were all posted on my channel,  Innuendo Studios . After wrapping a successful Kickstarter in 2014, I got to treat Innuendo Studios as a job, clearing some freelance work off my plate and releasing videos at a semi-regular clip. But Kickstarter money doesn't last forever, so Patreon is our shot at keeping the channel going indefinitely. If you're here, I'm assuming you know the basics of how Patreon works. (Just in case: think of Patreon as a subscription to my work. You pledge to throw a few dollars at me each time I release a video. If enough people make that pledge, I can afford to keep making them on the regular.) What I will tell you is that making these videos is the best job I've ever had. No matter what, I'm going to keep releasing videos as long as I feel I have things to say and there are people interested in hearing them. Just how often that is will be up to you! Let's talk goals: Right Now: Part-time Job At $800 per video, I can afford to keep the ads turned off on YouTube, no matter what. Between rent, bills, and student loans, I still can't promise any kind of regular schedule, but the videos will be making enough to justify making time for them whenever possible. This is the point where I can guarantee that Innuendo Studios isn't going anywhere. But it could be more if: At $1600 Per Month: Career This would cover rent, food, bills, basic cost of living, and maybe, now and again, a few hundred bucks in the savings account. I'd clear most freelance work from my schedule - just the stuff I can fit around Innuendo Studios. Bare minimum, 10-15 minutes of content would come out every month. This would also pay for additional things like written pieces ( did you know I do some writing? ). For the time being, this would be my job, and I'd get to keep working the best job in the universe! At $2400 Per Month: Media Empire This is shooting the moon and I'm not entire sure what happens here, but at this point Innuendo Studios could be a real... thing. Which means it could ramp up and branch out. We could boost the production values, start a podcast, give lectures at conferences, and who knows what else! I'd run some polls with the backers to see what things interest them, and we'd go from there. What You Get In Return $1 patrons will get the videos a day early. $5 patrons will get access to annotated versions of the videos (several of which already exist). And $10 patrons will get access to the Behind the Scenes blog where I talk shop about how the videos get made, what's in production, and as much data and observation about crowdfunding as I can manage - hopefully this will be useful to anyone thinking of running a crowdfunding campaign themselves. You would also get my deepest, sincerest thanks. Like, seriously, if you help keep this channel alive, you're on my list of rad people.

You get to save a lot of money on my weekly art lessons and in turn, you allow me to keep upgrading my equipment, pay rent, and make even more videos. It‚Äôs an endless cycle of awesome!! WHAT?! I like rewards!!! What do I get in addition to the tutorials?! You can choose to sign up for the $4/month or $9/month tier each with a different set of rewards! YAY STUFF! ¬†For both $4 and $9/¬† month pledges - 1-2 Hour Long Painting & Drawing Tutorials¬† --¬† See my full patreon video library here! 4 new art lessons each month plus over 300 past lessons/demonstrations 5 monthly reference photos When you sign up at $4 or more a month, you get instant access to over 300 of my past 1-2 hour-long tutorials plus a new lesson every single week! These videos are slowed down to real-time for some sections and slightly sped up for others. I will explain what I‚Äôm doing and why I make certain decisions in the process while I work. With these videos being so much slower than my usual youtube videos you will have an easier time understanding my layering, blending and other techniques. These tutorials vary in medium each week. I rotate between Colored Pencil, Acrylic Painting, Oil Painting, Graphite and Inktense, watercolor pencil, watercolor, pan pastels and charcoal.¬† For both $4 and $9/  month pledges - 5 Royalty Free Reference Photos Each Month Each month I provide you with 5 reference photos I‚Äôve taken myself!

Sometimes this will be based on that week‚Äôs art lesson, but when the art lesson is from a reference photo you would need to pay for (like from wildlife reference photos) I will provide another fun coloring page off of past artwork. Can these coloring pages be used as line art for your actual paintings and drawings? Sure, but I don‚Äôt recommend it. Let me explain why.  I‚Äôve been teaching painting and drawing lessons since 1999. In that time I‚Äôve found that having students trace their references does help them to improve their drawing skills much faster than freehanding alone. However, I also found that you can hit a point where you‚Äôre doing too much for the student and you cross the line between helping someone to learn and just doing the work for them.  If I trace the work for you, you‚Äôre not learning to draw. You‚Äôre not learning how to take a reference photo of your own and have that tracing show you things in the reference you wouldn‚Äôt have otherwise noticed. I feel you‚Äôre skipping a very valuable step in helping you to improve your own work so that you can take any reference photo and make a beautiful painting from it.  If you want to use my coloring pages to create practice paintings you can, but you really will learn much more from tracing actual photos than my work. Besides that, the line drawing is not going to be as accurate as a photograph. I may include things that make for a better coloring page but may not be useful in your line art for your paintings. Discount on Prints I will have a new discount code each month that will give you my cost on any print from my print site  https://lachri.pixels.com/ Extra Photos from my social media I regularly post shots of my red eyed tree frogs, saltwater fish, greyhounds and more on my  MeWe  account. If you follow me there you are welcome at this tier to use any of those photos in your own artwork! I post more tree frog photos than anything else. For $19/month pledges, you also get greeting cards and a sticker! 4 new art lessons each month plus over 300 past lessons/demonstrations 10 monthly reference photos group challenge Postcard with my artwork 4 coloring pages each month My cost for all prints from  https://lachri.pixels.com 4.6\" x 7.2\" greeting card with my art Your postcards will now be included in the envelope with the greeting card Art sticker Greeting Card This card is 4.6x7.2\" printed on matte cardstock.

The sometimes unsolicited input I was giving others wasn't always being received well, despite the best of intentions. \"I'm concerned about the inflammatory cytokines your adipocytes may be secreting.\" Funny and awkward, I know. Granny just wasn't havin' it. The issue I was confronting in my social life was that I had come to realize that much of the human suffering on the planet might be avoided, or at least delayed ‚Äì with the right information. The knowledge and experience I had begun accumulating in my diverse roles as a scientist ‚Äì starting as early as my undergraduate days, when I was conducting lab experiments on worms to understand the aging process ‚Äì had ignited a passion to share. I needed an outlet. Enter¬† FoundMyFitness. When you¬† read this website  or¬† watch our videos¬† or¬† listen to our podcasts , you are reaping the benefits of what has been the realization of a vision I had for empowering the people I care about to take action in their own lives to live better, happier, and even longer. Sometimes even modest, well-informed changes can drive larger results than might be expected by functioning as building blocks that create positive action in a feedforward pattern of behavioral change. But there is still a problem. Getting accurate information is difficult. Conflicting studies are published every day, raising difficult questions. Can I eat eggs? One day they're bad for us, the next month they're good for us, then a year later they're bad for us again. What about saturated fat? Some studies show it causes heart disease, and other studies say it may make you live longer. Sometimes perverse incentives fuel contradictions, and sometimes teasing out nuance from the scientific record just takes time. While I don't have all of the answers, one of the unique qualities of the FoundMyFitness approach to providing information ‚Äî something I feel that we offer and very few platforms can even approach ‚Äî is our special focus on taking some of the scientific topics subject to scrutiny from lay journalists and backtesting the narrative against what the scientific literature actually says across multiple types of evidence, from observational studies to controlled trials to mechanistic work. Each of these, in turn, contribute their own unique part of a better story that may weather the storm of publication bias and other challenges. If you value what the team and I are doing, ‚Ä®please consider becoming a Premium Member. When you become a FMF supporter, not only will you get member-exclusive content and access but you will also help us do more of the important work of FoundMyFitness: informing, sometimes even rebutting, but, more importantly, synthesizing cross-disciplinary science-focused content. With a bigger team, we can produce and deliver even more high-quality, well-researched information and the wider public and scientific community can continue to enjoy the (almost entirely free) beneficial impact of an utterly unique idea incubator serving the fields of aging, nutrition, wellness, mental health, well-being, and more. That means we need to grow. In order to make the economics work for the explicit purpose of creating more of the world's best content on healthspan, we've given special thought to how to do so in a way that, I hope, feels authentically additive and true to the founding ethos of FoundMyFitness of creating maximum value and impact ‚Äì not just for members, but also the world. Moving forward,¬† we will offer a host of new benefits and an entire membership experience unique to what we are calling the \"premium membership\" tier.

Thank you for stopping by and for your consideration in supporting me. My name is Karen Hallion and I am located on the Northshore of Massachusetts. I went to Ringling School of Art and Design and graduated with a BFA in Illustration, was an elementary school art teacher for many years and now I work full-time as an artist. I have done licensed work for some amazing companies such as LucasFilm, Cartoon Network, DreamWorks Studios, Her Universe, Disney, Patrick Rothfuss, Chronicle Books, as well as freelance work for Disney Imagineering.  In 2013, I won DreamWorks Studios‚Äô ‚ÄúHow to Train Your Dragon‚Äù t-shirt design contest. In 2015, I designed the art for the ‚ÄúWizard School‚Äù card game created by DFTBA Games and Hank Green, which raised more than $450,000 via Kickstarter. I also raised more than $70,000 via Kickstarter in 2017 to fund the creation of my original character, Celara, via a 13 month calendar. In 2018, I was a contributing artist for the book Star Wars: Women of the Galaxy by Amy Ratcliffe and I illustrated the Doctor Who 13th #1 Newbury Comics Exclusive Variant Comic published by Titan Comics. And¬† I recently illustrated the exclusive covers for the 2019 Star Wars Celebration\nedition of Star Wars Insider Magazine. I created my Patreon page to build a place for myself and my fans to connect and interact in a more unique manner than on social media. Here you will fine exclusive content, videos, works in progress, sneak peaks, and more! You also have the opportunity to decide what I illustrate each month and make suggestions for future work. Your valued support of my Patreon page enables me to do what I love and for that, I am deeply grateful. Please read on for more details in the FAQs below and don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out if you have any additional questions. I hope this platform serves as a place where you can not only support my business, but where you can be inspired and rewarded too! FAQ This FAQ is for my specific Patreon page and program. If you have questions about Patreon in general, questions about address changes for physical rewards, billing, payments, software, what patronage is, etc. please also visit the official  Patreon Help Center here: https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us Q: What is Patreon?  A: Patreon is a crowdfunding platform that enables artists to obtain funding from their fans or patrons. Patrons pledge to donate a fixed amount of money to an artist every month in exchange for rewards.  Q: How much does it cost? What do I get? A: Depending on what tier you subscribe to, anything from $1/month to $35 monthly. I have eight reward tiers; $1, $3, $5, $10, $15, $20, $25 and $35 and my rewards currently include downloadable coloring pages, tutorial videos, postcards and prints, depending on the level you choose. Each level builds upon the previous in terms of the rewards you receive. For example, if you choose the $10 reward, you'll have access to all the rewards below it at the $1, $3, $5 levels as well.  You can cancel your pledge or change your pledge amount at any point and will take effect the first of the following month. For detailed tier descriptions, look to the right of this text and read more about the rewards included in each level. Q: What does my money go for? A: Mainly, it goes towards supporting my career as an artist! It helps with the expenses of my day-to-day life, paying bills and maintaining my business, which includes buying merchandise, legal fees, and equipment costs such as my Cintiq, art supplies, website administration, and travel expenses so I can attend conventions to meet fans in person. Without the support from Patreon, I would have to find another full-time job, which would not allow me to create art or travel at my current capacity. To see my upcoming schedule of events, click here:¬† https://www.karenhallion.com/appearances Q: What do you use to draw/paint with? A: Most of my work is digital these days, I use Photoshop CC and a Wacom Cintiq 21UX. I also use brushes I purchased from Ray Frenden I love the organic inker one and set it at 50% opacity when I sketch.  I also use the grease pencil when I sketch. When inking and coloring, I use the organic inker at 100%.  Other than messing with the opacity and size, I don't change any other settings. In the past, when I have worked traditionally, I have used watercolors, acrylics, colored pencil, and tea. Lately, though, I have become addicted to Copic markers and ink pens. When I sketch, I use Prismacolor Turquoise, 2B and a kneaded eraser on either bristol paper, or illustration board. Q: Do you have a Deviant Art/Tumblr/Pinterest/Instagram etc. Yep, I am EVERYWHERE.  DA:   http://khallion.deviantart.com/ Pinterest:   http://pinterest.com/khallion/ Tumblr:   http://karenhallion.tumblr.com/ ¬†Instagram:   http://instagram.com/karenhallionart/ Twitter: @khallion Website:  www.karenhallion.com Q: I am an artist; can you give me any advice? A: I get this one a LOT, and I always try to answer when I can, though sometimes it takes a few days. It's been over 15 years since I graduated from art school, and it has taken a lot of work for me to be able to make a living freelancing. Some of the thing that have helped me, other than hard work and not giving up, are join an artist's group and learning from the talented people in there. Sub work to companies you want to work with, and when it gets rejected, do more work and sub it. Just keep moving forward (advice from Walt Disney). Use social media. Learn the best way to use it, and USE IT. It's free advertising, and it works. Find artists you love, and study what they do, and learn from them. Take advice and critiques, ignore the haters. Draw what you love, not necessarily what you think will sell. Help out other artists when you can. Q: Do you take commissions? A: No, unfortunately between my freelance work and other projects, I am unable to take commissions at this time. Q: I have other questions! A: Well, then email us! :)  [email¬†protected]", "amount_post": 399, "amount_subs": 1, "price_tiers": [{"title": "Tier 1", "monthly": "$1", "description": "Access to my patron-only feed.

Working as an art teacher, can be really rewarding, but also very time consuming and I'd love eventually to be able to produce my own art full time and spend all my day sharing my creative journey with my supporters. I've always been way more focused on developing my personal vision and achieving the best I can technically than I have making money from selling work. I have never liked the idea of my art being only for the rich and privileged few, so¬†I will continue to create free content on YouTube and hope that access to my work continues to inspire those without the means to pay. I am looking forward to a time when I can really dig deeper into my own art practice and tutorials. Any help I receive from my supporters, will be massively encouraging for me to carry on building my vision and I hope by sharing my practice I will continue to help and inspire others along the way. I am happy to offer a variety of rewards, that will include full resolution images, sneak peeks at work in progress, exclusive videos for patrons etc. I would especially like to be able to offer a limited number of monthly one to one live Skype/Google hangout tutorials to people that really want to push forwards with their own practice or simply learn more about the way I work.", "amount_post": 278, "amount_subs": 1, "price_tiers": [{"title": "Become A Patron", "monthly": "$10", "description": "Help me to grow!\n \n Rewards include:- \n¬†¬† \n \n COLOUR SWATCH FILES -  Save time and download the colour palettes CONNECT WITH PATRONS -  Chat with artists and patrons.

You can find out more about my work, and read many of my comics, on my¬† portfolio . \n\t \n\tBecoming one of my patrons will give you a look into my process and work, including my weird tangents, my failures and disappointments, and my strange experiments. I look forward to showing you all of the things I love playing with. I make a lot of art(I have a short attention span), and I am constantly looking for ways to integrate activism and play into my work. \n\t¬† \n\tHere are my current and recently completed projects, that Patreon helped to fund! \n\t \n \n Immersive Installation Art, and Keepsake Games: \n Salvage Station No. 8  was built in collaboration with Beam Camp, a summer camp that teaches kids how to build things! It was an immersive installation featuring multiple rooms and really detailed props and ephemera contributed by over 100+ adults and kids. \n \nThe Last Apothecary  is an immersive haunted house space apothecary installation. It is a narrative about an outer colony space apothecary obsessed with Old-Earth, and also about the persistence of ritual, the space immigrant diaspora, and the obsessive nature of archiving and collecting. It was installed at Burning Man 2016. \n \n Specimens  is an ongoing sculptural series, including curiosity cabinets and displays, and a photographic series of strange beasts in the wild, photographed in national parks across America. The Gentle Oraclebird  is a kind and gentle fortune telling system that performs in unexpected places. \n A Mending  is¬†a solo story-building and keepsake game about two friends who have been parted for some time, using sewing, embroidery, and map-marking mechanics.  Field Guide to Memory , with Jeeyon Shim, is a solo journalling keepsake and connected path game¬†about legacy, wonder, cryptids and the vastness of a human life. \nComics and Illustration: \nThanks to my Patreon subscribers, most of my comics are available for free by default. In addition, I frequently post smaller autobiographical comics as Patreon exclusives.¬† \n Curiosity Americana  is a series at Catapult where I explore¬†icons, roadside attractions, and various objects of Americana as part of my effort to find and assert my place as an immigrant within this country‚Äôs mythos. \n Center for Otherworld Science  is an ongoing comic about interpersonal relationships in a  cryptozoological institute. \n Tiny Adventure Journal  is a travelogue comic. It's where I document my love for cheap travel, weird museums, national parks, Paul Bunyan statues, abandoned places, most animals that are not ostriches, and odd Americana.  \n Resist : A collection of art released for free(under a Creative Commons license) around the theme of political resistance. All pay-what-you-can proceeds go to a non profit working to overturn discriminatory and unconstitutional restrictions on immigration in the United States. \n \n Experimental Art and Art Activism: \nPatreon supports a lot of work that I do not get paid for. Some of this involves my silly and playful experimental tech art, such as the¬† TenderDnD  Twitter bot, which populates a world full of kind, queer and gentle characters and NPCs. Other projects include the¬† Gentle Oraclebird bot , and my¬† shitty fortune generator ! It also funds Space Gnome Mercantile, a trade-by-mail program for my Patreon subscribers. It has also allowed me to work on endurance art projects like painting the Statue of Liberty 40 times in 10 hours to raise money for the ACLU, and¬† #resistancecranes , in collaboration with two dear friends of mine, where we've raised $20,000 for the National Immigration Law Center, RAICES and International Rescue Committee by folding 1000 cranes in 24 hours in 2017 and 2018. I am also a co-founder of¬† Project Pizza , with my friend Eron Rauch, which has raised over $18,000 over three years for a local food non-profit, Food Forward. Sometimes, this work leads to some accidental fundraising, like the almost $200,000 I raised for voting rights organizations in Georgia with this¬† Four Seasons Total Landscaping Gritty T-Shirt . \n \n About the Rewards: \n \n The Dustbear Quarterly: A thoughtfully curated quarterly box of the work I‚Äôve been doing that season, which will usually include zines, limited edition prints, postcard sets, new pins and other merch, other experimental art or delightful objects, as well as longer graphic novels and other projects I‚Äôve been working on. It also includes: A quarterly letter explaining what I‚Äôve been up to, what I am thinking about, and the ups and downs of my life as an artist who's trying their best. Everything in the MAIL DAY subscription(sent monthly, and separately)! \n \n The MAIL DAY Subscription: \nThis subscription means that you will receive flat objects in the mail, including postcards, strange games or divinations, and/or limited prints, sent to you in the mail on a monthly basis, as they are made. These may include small notes telling you what I‚Äôve been doing, little encouragements for your day, Oraclebird fortunes, one page games, or messages from gnomes or fish. \n Every now and then, this subscription converts to a limited time epistolary short story delivery with an ongoing narrative that spans 3-6 months.¬†", "amount_post": 272, "amount_subs": 991, "price_tiers": [{"title": null, "monthly": "$2", "description": "Access to all my Patreon-only blog posts.

We do the weird stuff. ¬†This Patreon is dedicated to our regular output, which, as of now, is 70% our lewd femboy game,  Tales of Androgyny ¬†- and 30% other lewd images and stories featuring men, women (with or without dangly bits), and various androgynous and feminine characters that run the gamut of femboys, futa, and other, well, androgynous characters.¬† There's a lot of focus on curves, colors, and colons. ¬† Below we have the features of our Patreon laid out - we've also got our reward tiers listed out on the right-hand panel for your perusing pleasure. ¬†We have  four  updates every month, more or less guaranteed - full color pictures, story chapters, or game updates. ¬†You can restrict  how many updates you support , so it is flexible. Tales of Androgyny Tales of Androgyny ¬†is our homegrown roguelite femboy and futa-focused game. ¬†You can read an up-to-date description of it (and try the public build)¬† here . ¬†We're hoping to make a game that's not only erotic, but also has rich, fun gameplay that rewards players for creative thinking, and makes sex part of the game design, rather than auxiliary to it, or vice versa. ¬†It'll be highly replayable, with multiple gameplay modes, character customization, challenges and¬†procedural¬†generation of adventurers, and, down the road, mods and custom content. ¬†There will be a story mode with a central narrative, but the full game mode will be focused on challenging, well-designed gameplay. The featured kinks are, in order of prevalence (kind of): femme boys, women with dongs, domination/submission, monster girls (also often with dongs), humiliation and femdom, particularly pegging of various varieties, plenty of anal, oral,¬†descent into hedonism and depravity, knotting, corruption, giantesses, amazons, thick and curvy women, monsters, facials and bukkake, oviposition, sliiiiiimes and googirls, and many more. Some of the more extreme kinks have toggles to protect delicate eyes and sensibilities, but you wouldn't use those, would you? Patrons are able to vote on the assets that will make it into the game sooner, if at all - this includes encounters/events, characters, animations, and possibly even whole storylines and game modes. These are monthly surveys that are sent out to patrons of the required tiers, and votes are tallied based on tier and updates supported. The Dropbox Gallery If you are a new patron and you want access to the Dropbox: check our post feed and look for the tag \"Dropbox\" - the most recent posts with the appropriate links should be up top. ¬†If you receive an email containing the links and they don't work, make sure to search for those posts, as they may have been edited after the email was sent. ¬†If you can't find the links, please message us directly via Patreon's \"Send Message\" functionality, rather than making a new post on the public feed! Thank you! While most of our work is publicly accessible, works in progress and works that never make it to a finished, public-facing venue are all compiled here on our Dropbox. ¬†As of December of 2016, it will include effectively all of our collected works since we started. ¬†Depending on your reward tier, you may also have access to our raw PSD/SAI files and any HiRes pngs or jpegs of our released work (Bunny Tier+) or alternates that were done for works that are completed (Dragon Tier+), as well as downloads of our recorded livestreams (Dragon Tier+), among other things. ¬†Starting in November of 2016, you'll also have access, again depending on tier, to our patron-only builds of  Tales of Androgyny , including a monthly build (Pony Tier+), and weekly builds (Bunny Tier+). *Access to the dropbox folders and their respective passwords for the month are sent out the day after Patreon processes pledges, and is sent to all processed patrons.

Disclaimer The themes present in our work, whether it's our art, our stories, or  Tales of Androgyny ,  are purely for erotic purposes. They don't represent our views on actual people, or how sex should occur in real life. We try to be sparing in our use of slurs and language that is meant to demean or dehumanize people - but fetishes being what they are, they do crop up from time to time, and they are meant purely for the enjoyment of the reader. Just as we wouldn't condone real violence, despite the game featuring swords and spears, we do not condone the sexually predatory nature of some characters that feature in our work, nor do we think that their natures endorse real-world equivalents.

I‚Äôm so glad you are here. This is a new and exciting adventure for me. A way to connect us all in a more meaningful way. A way to create together. A spot where I can keep you informed of all of the exciting things that I‚Äôm building for us. A safe space to dialogue. A community of badasses. And a way for you to support my work so that I can do even more in service to a just world!   What‚Äôs my story? My name is Shannon Downey, but I‚Äôm better known as Badass Cross Stitch. I am a queer art activist that lives full-time in my RV traveling the United States (and hopefully the rest of the world when the borders open back up) in an attempt to know everyone and trick people into hanging out with me by teaching them how to embroider ‚Äì BUT really what I‚Äôm doing is getting them to have hard conversations with strangers around political and social issues. Then I listen, figure out what barriers exist to them taking more action on these issues, solve for those barriers, and cheerlead them on their path as activists!  So tricky right? You can learn more here:  www.BadassCrossStitch.com Well now I am building a digital community space for us. I‚Äôm sick of the social media game where they get to determine who sees or does not see what I‚Äôm putting out there for you. Plus, this will build in a way for you to support the work that I‚Äôm doing, get even more involved, and connect and build relationships with other community members! So, in service to all of us I have created ‚Äì   Badass United ‚Äì so that I can maximize impact and ensure that you all can opt in and know about everything that is going on so you don‚Äôt miss anything. AND I have like a zillion new ideas that I will now have time to actually implement and get in front of you!   What is patreon? Basically, it‚Äôs both a community space for us that I manage and a way for community to support my work so that I can keep doing it. It allows me to create for you and with you. Like everything I have been doing for years but now in this handy digital space.  It is built on a monthly subscription process ‚Äì which is going to be GREAT because then we don‚Äôt have to one-off everything. If you are team  Badasses United  ‚Äì you are in for all of the stuff. Workshops, trainings, patterns, events, lectures, projects, stitch-ups, and everything else I come up with from this point on. And there will be special events, gifts, and surprises just for the Badass United community.   It also has the added benefit of being a closed community so y‚Äôall can have in depth and meaningful conversations and discussions and I am hoping it cuts down on some of those pesky death threats I get each week.  I have six support levels and like everything I do it‚Äôs a bit of a pay-what-you-can model. Every level has access to all of the goods. I have included some add-ons for the higher levels, but no one is going to miss out on anything I‚Äôm building. Here‚Äôs a video by Patreon that explains further. What sort of stuff have we been doing together? Prior to the great sickness (I am so sick of having to say that), I was hosting hundreds of community stitch-ups, workshops, and art interventions. These were spaces for folks to get together, meet new people, learn to embroider, discuss issues of importance, and connect while enjoying a new hobby. I was pretty devastated when I set off in my RV with over 100 events planned and boom‚Ä¶global fucking pandemic. Obviously, all of those events were cancelled, and I had to pivot. That said, pivot I did! I actually had an amazing year of community building and engagement. Some highlights: Over 5,000 of you from around the world learned to embroider with me via Zoom Hundreds of you have attended my weekly Sunday stitch-ups and built amazing friendships‚Ä¶and we are now plotting how to buy a compound and all live together Over 10,000 of you participated in the January  Make Don‚Äôt Break  initiatives and developed a daily making practice 500 of you went through a Bystander Intervention Training 75 of my favorite Introverts and Highly Sensitive People took the Activism 101 workshop build just for you 500 of you attended the first Disrupting Craftivism Panel Discussion We celebrated Bob Ross, Phyllis LaTour Doyle, and Mister Roger‚Äôs birthday together in costume and with cocktails  And we are deep in planning for the launch of not one but two Craftivist-In-Residence programs in the United States!  Personally, I‚Äôve traveled to 26 states in my RV and parked in many of your driveways and we managed to display Rita‚Äôs Quilt in 6 of those states in covid-friendly ways I‚Äôve done 40 lectures for youth, colleges, libraries, and guilds And recently I‚Äôve finally been able to do some outdoor stitch-ups and actually meet some of you IN PERSON which is the highlight of my life. That‚Äôs a hell of a pandemic year y‚Äôall. YOU ARE AWESOME. The good news is ‚Äì I have endless ideas for us. I have more resources, more things to bring you, and more ways for you to get involved in the work and the movements. So much fun will continue to be had! I am excited to report that things are being planned and this coming year will see in person events and gatherings. This space will ensure that when I come through your town we can actually hang out! Or even better, we can plan shit together. What are we going to do together moving forward? My work is in service to you and a just world. Supporting the work means creating more resources and opportunities for you and for us to take action and grow. Community first. Here‚Äôs some of the things we will do within the Patreon community: Stitch-ups Community projects Guest speakers Craftivism panels Radical skill share trainings Art challenges Activism challenges Tutorials Free patterns Art + prize raffles And a million more things as I think of them! New for 2022 This year, I will be dropping a new video stitch tutorial every Saturday for the whole year! You can learn 52 different stitches. There will be samplers + stitch-ups + workshops to support your progress. This is going to be exciting!!! In closing You are a badass. I am a badass. Let‚Äôs be badasses together!

It gives me a narrow focus of analytical content for Munster and Ireland without diving into much of the nonsense you get with bloggers. I now spend just ‚Ç¨2 on my rugby content a month rather than ‚Ç¨2 for a daily newspaper.

Not necessarily gratis, but free to spread, use, and make new art from. Like the fairy tales of old, or folk music, art is at it‚Äôs heart a communal effort. It is a way of commununication, not a commodity.  I make art and release it under Creative Commons licenses, so you can use it exactly as you see fit.  As the copyright industries tighten their grip of the internet, infringing on our privacy, our freedom of speech, and our human rights in the process, we as artists need to find new, free ways of distributing our art, that is in line with the nature of art itself. That‚Äôs is what I‚Äôm trying to do. What is Patreon? Patreon is a crowdfunding service, like Kickstarter or Indiegogo. It allows you to back creators on a regular basis, instead of a onetime sum. I'm asking for monthly donations, to allow me to create even more free content. So, who am I? I‚Äôm Kim Holm, an artist from Bergen, Norway, creating art that delves the depths of darkness and sometimes brings up a little light.  I have worked as an illustrator, comic book artist, and teacher, but am now focusing on fine art.  On TikTok I've been creating videos since 2020, with daily ink monsters, mythology, and opinions on art, mental health, and politics, reaching millions of viewers and over 400 000 followers.  I‚Äôve released books, comics, held exhibitions, and am occasionally capturing black metal music from the side of the stage at concerts, having drawn over 2000 live concert drawings, all available for free use. I have worked with bands like Solstafir, Vreid, 1349, Primordial, and many more.  I have worked professionally since 2004, and  my online gallery has over 4 GB‚Äôs of art for free use. I am also, like many artists, suffering from depressions and bi-polar disorder. And that‚Äôs one of the main reasons I need your help. Over the years I have shown that I‚Äôm willing to put in the work, but unfortunately my head doesn‚Äôt always play ball, and getting consistency, either it be in comic book projects or social media promotion, has been a huge problem. I'm also a family man, with a wife and two small kids. So everything I do is also for the stability for us all.   So I‚Äôm humbly asking for help getting back on my feet, so I can produce even more and better art than already. No matter what, I will never stop making free art.  So what will you use the money on? Everything I get on will go directly into just surviving so that I can produce more art. If I someday get more than I need, it will go into producing more free art in some shape of form.  There are a lot of expenses just hosting hi-resolution art, scanning, photographing art, storage, and not the least materials to make art with.  I will also continue doing exhibitions, selling artwork,  doing work for bands and individuals, so I‚Äôm not planning on making Patreon my sole income. But every single dollar I get from here will help me more than you can ever know.  So what‚Äôs in it for you, my patrons? Well, I tried having different types of rewards in the past, and that simply didn‚Äôt work. So the only reward you get for supporting me is early access to a great deal of work that‚Äôs not yet released, and some updates, videos, and exclusive small things once in a while.  If you supported me before 2019¬∏ and haven‚Äôt gotten your physical rewards, contact me and we‚Äôll sort it out. How often will I release art? More and more, that depends. I‚Äôve tried sticking to schedules before, but I can only stick with them for a while before they are broken by one of my depressive periods.  But even through the first years on Patreon, where I was regularly unable to keep my commitments because of depression, I released hundreds and hundreds of artworks for free use. And as I search for more stability, I will continue trying to make even better art.  But copyright? Pirates? Do I hate artists? Not at all. I just think the copyright system has failed. We need a system that protects the consumers, freedom of information, and freedom of speech. We can create a system that pays content creator in a fair way without infringing these rights. And most importantly, I think art itself suffers until we change the system. With copyright, we can nevermore have folk-music, folk-heroes, or folk-art. Art is just a commodity. The system encourages plagiarism, and allows for corporations to steal creative work from their creators. It allows work to fall into obscurity and disappear forever because its owners don't see the value in them. It creates an atmosphere where we are all limit the stories and images and possibilities in our own mind. So, I fight the current system of intellectual property because I love art.  You can't support me, you say? Well, there's other ways to support me as well, such as following me on social media, interacting, liking, sharing, and telling people about my art.  https://www.tiktok.com/@denungeherrholm? www.facebook.com/DUHHfans www.youtube.com/denungeherrholm www.instagram.com/denungeherrholm www.twitter.com/denungeherrholm And most importantly, support my art by using it for your project.

Quindi discussione, informazione e guida all'acquisto formata da  first looks  e talvolta  recensioni , ove cerco di renderMi il pi√π utile possibile attraverso la mia esperienza e competenze, delle quali non ci si deve mai accontentare: non si smette mai di studiare, ragazzi, ed anche se i videogiochi nascono come puro e prezioso (unico) intrattenimento, vi √® molto da  non  prendere alla leggera, anzi. Sono poi presenti due canali secondari:¬† -¬† Sabaku no Pureeyaa , ove si videogioca creando contenuti meno impegnati ma con una \"morale\" alle spalle, e... -¬† Sabaku no Sutoriimaa , un canale di streaming su Twitch, in cui si affrontano Talk Show/Let's Play e serate post-orario di lavoro insieme. }¬∞{ Come utilizzo il denaro che mi donerete? Youtube monetizza (in Italia  relativamente ¬† poco  rispetto a molti altri paesi) i contenuti, ma √® una piattaforma che basa se stessa sulla  quantit√†: ¬†comunque la si voglia vedere, quantit√†. Quello che faccio, a livello economico,  √® stupido . Youtube non ama video a cadenza lenta o che siano lunghi, ed oltretutto il mio lavoro richiede  dozzine  di¬†ore di lavoro per ciascuna pubblicazione.  Non √® qualcosa di sostenibile rispetto alle \"regole\" del sito. In passato ognuno di essi richiedeva mesi per la produzione, le vostre donazioni mi permettono non solo di dedicarmi full-time a questo, ma di evolverlo ed elevarlo a progetti molto pi√π complessi e completi. In altre parole: Acquisire qu alit√† tecnica e contenutistica ¬†in  costante upgrade : risoluzione/framerate, estetica e strumenti di lavoro professionalmente dignitosi. Acquistare  hardware, ¬† software e conseguenti plugins  di post-produzione come \"tools\" specifici aggiornati anno dopo anno. Assumere  artisti  quali  disegnatori ,  animatori ,  musicisti . Permettere l'ignoramento delle meccaniche commerciali, per produrre contenuti complessi e completi, piuttosto che rapidi e veloci. Permettermi di ignorare numerose tipologie di sponsorship invasive. Conclusioni? Aprire le porte a strumenti avanzati nelle mani di un ex-professionista pu√≤ valere non poco, e per quanto continui a studiare per evolvere a priori come content creator e critico, il supporto datomi da tutti coloro che vogliono parteciparvi mi ha permesso di portare il canale ed il suo contenuto ad un livello considerevolmente pi√π alto rispetto a ci√≤ che era possibile prima del crowdfunding. L'obiettivo √®  sempre  trasformare un canale video in un centro culturale e punto di riferimento per l'appassionato, un portale universale sul Videogioco attraverso essi stessi come il loro mercato ed industria. ...E, quindi, semplicemente permettermi di continuare su questo percorso, sul quale scommetto.

I'm Philip and I welcome you to my Patreon page! I'm a professional illustrator and artist and I love creating environments and landscape illustrations. To put it simply on how Patreon works:  As I have two tiers, you can choose which tier suits you most. If you're just looking for my high quality artwork JPEGS, then the  VISIONARY  tier will be fit for you. If you're wanting to learn and get access to tutorials and process videos + more, then the  MYTHIC  tier will be best as this tier includes all my available content and resources.  Please note that you will be charged your pledge amount upon joining, then a monthly charge of your pledge amount on the same day of the next month. I use Adobe Photoshop as my preferred software but my techniques and methods within my tutorials and process videos can be followed using other similar drawing softwares! Because I mainly use layers, clipping masks, brush/eraser tools and no special tricks (all of which are available across a wide range of drawing softwares) it won't be an issue to follow along even if you use Procreate, Clip Studio etc. --------------------------------------------------- Monthly Exclusive Patreon Tutorials: ¬†Every month, my patrons will submit ideas of the tutorial they'd like to see. Then I will compile a list and go through a poll to decide which idea gets voted most on. If you tutorial gets lots of votes but doesn't make it, don't worry, it can be on the next month's tutorial or a new poll. These exclusive tutorials will usually get released near the end of the month - there will also be a download link for these sent out to you via Patreon messages at the start of the new month after pledges in the new month are collected. All Content: ¬†I will be uploading content on here every week, which consists of process videos, layered Photoshop files, high-quality wallpapers and my brushes. These are all available for you to watch through here on Patreon and you will also get access to watch every single video I have ever uploaded. --------------------------------------------------- With your support through Patreon,  I can focus more of my time into creating more personal illustrations and sharing educational content with you. It is my ultimate goal to freely create work that I love, to inspire others and to pass on the knowledge I gain to others so they too can create beautiful artwork. However way you choose to support me I honestly thank you from the bottom of my heart. I¬†want to thank you for your interest and taking the time to read this! :) I appreciate YOU and your support!

My name is Susan Jenkins and I am an artist and author with a passion for teaching and providing art instruction to those who may have limited means or ability to pay for art lessons, travel to workshops, etc. (See the above intro video for a sample of my free tutorials offered on YouTube) My YouTube Channel, Monet Cafe', was a dream of mine that started many years ago. Because I was limited financially early in my art career and went through a time of being a single mother, with three boys, I decided that if I became successful in my artistic goals I would \"give back\" to those who may have circumstances like mine. The Monet Cafe' YouTube channel now has over 63,000 subscribers from all over the world, and the Monet Cafe' Art Group on Facebook has over 15,000 members. I'm so blessed to experience the beauty of how such a diverse group of people can share their artistic passions in such a loving and giving way.¬† It's always my goal to bring FREE tutorials, but of course it is time consuming and the cost of video equipment and supplies can get expensive. I have been providing the free tutorials on YouTube for nearly 6 years, and I am so blessed that many of you are now sharing that you would like to support my efforts to continue this free service, and Patreon is a safe and easy way to do that. My art instruction leans heavily toward the medium of soft pastels, as I have fallen in love with this medium; however, I often add mixed media to my creations and also love watercolor, gouache, acrylics and more.¬† What you can expect: Free Tutorials on the Monet Cafe' YouTube Channel:¬† I am starting to offer more BEGINNER lessons that have been highly requested. These videos will take you through the very basics of good composition, color theory, materials, and as always, affordable ways to create art on a budget.¬† For Patreon Subscribers:  1. Special Behind-the-Scene content not offered on the YouTube Channel (product reviews, studio tips and more) 2. Story Time: This is a fun weekly lesson where I read from my favorite art books, give my input and tips and often give a tutorial as well.  3. Extra Real-Time Content and Commentary: Patrons will gain access to the full video tutorials not available on the Monet Cafe' channel.¬† 4. Art Quizzes: This is a patron favorite! I often give a color tests and exercises that will help to hone your artistic skills.¬† 5. Homework Album: My patrons can submit their paintings (from any tutorial or lesson) to our shared Homework Album. This is a great way for me to see your progress and for the group to enjoy and offer encouragement.¬† 6. Facebook Group just for my Patrons: My patrons are eligible to be members of my private FB group where we share art and conversation together.¬† 7. Access to my Private DISCORD Server:¬† Discord is such a great platform for live chatting and conversation. My Discord page has multiple categories from: \"What's on Your Easel\" to \"Music to Paint by\". It's a fun and engaging way to share art and make friends.¬† WHEW!!

I paint the traditional way, with paint and water on wood panels by hand. I paint all the time, and began the official Strangeling brand and website with my painting career as a teenager online back in 1997. ¬†Lots of beautiful big eyed girls, faeries, mermaids, pop surrealism, new gothic art, new contemporary, magic realism, lowbrow and highbrow, fantasy art and such.  If you have ever visited a Disney themepark, browsed through an art magazine, bought something from the Bradford Exchange, hung out at comic conventions, been to a faerie festival, colored coloring books, collected enamel pins, stumbled across my¬†¬† 1.6 Million Fans on Facebook , or visited my¬† Strangeling.com  website you are probably familiar with my work.  I hope you enjoy it, and if you don't - just stick around, I'm always painting more.  I joined Patreon to create a space for myself and for my fans, collectors and patrons to connect and interact in a way beyond that of existing social media.  Patreon is where you will find exclusive content unavailable anywhere else, the home of my Strangeling Pins subscription club, advance notifications and sneak previews, views of my daily life through my eyes via frequent Patreon Lens snippets, tutorials and live painting, a lot of \"Behind the Scenes\" content, and depending on what patronage tier you subscribe to - even get \"first dibs\" and \"reservations\" on original paintings and hard-to-get Masterpiece Editions.¬† Here we have the¬† Patreon Pin Collector Tier ¬†is where you receive Patreon Exclusive pins, new Pins of the Month each month and more!¬†¬† And yes, I am the artist who has voluntarily relinquished many of my copyrights to the Public Domain,  so if you are looking for her, I am she and you have come to the right place!¬† For the initial release of the \"Project 625\" high resolution files - scans of 625 original acrylic paintings for your unlimited personal or commercial use - those are available at  https://downloads.strangeling.com   - if you enjoy getting the free stuff faster and have new images available for your use before the general public gets the opportunity, definitely join me here at Patreon even the $1 tier and you're in!¬† We also welcome corporate and commercial partners - if you're doing something cool with my artwork, and you're feeling generous enough to throw a percentage or make a public pledge, I'd love to support you back and spread the word and work together to get my artwork out to the people who love it.¬† And no, there are no strings attached, I hate being strung along too. SCROLL DOWN past the artwork to read the rewards associated with the various tiers, and to read the FAQ. ***** Below are some examples of my original paintings - all my paintings are in acrylics.¬† Here at Patreon you can see them and even often reserve them to purchase direct from me before the public sees them! ***** Here are some \"Works-in-Progress\" - paintings while I'm working on them!  I post timelapses from my easel throughout the day on Patreon Lens, livestream painting, videos, tutorials, photos and more coming soon.  All are acrylic paints and water typically on wood panel. ***** Here are some of the many paintings I paint for the Walt Disney Company - available from Disney through WonderGround Galleries in Disneyland and Disney World, Marketplace Co-Op in Disney World, Art of Disney, Off the Page, Epcot International Festival of the Arts, various Star Wars outposts and throughout the themeparks. ¬©Disney and ¬©LucasFilm on these ones. ***** Here are some various books and other publications I've done ***** And here are some various merchandise & product designs I've done with my art! To visit our free downloads site for the high resolution Strangeling Public Domain Project files, visit¬† https://downloads.strangeling.com By supporting my Patreon, you can receive in-depth looks, sneak peeks, advance announcements and more featuring all of the above.¬† And yes - you do get frankly amazing downloads, open commercial licenses to start your own Strangeling merchandise lines unrestricted with my Public Domain paintings and advance access to that for only a dollar.¬† Please read the FAQ below and then scroll down for details on the different support & reward tiers. ¬†Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. FAQ This FAQ is for my specific Patreon page and program.  If you have questions about Patreon in general, questions about billing, payments, software, what patronage is, etc. please also visit the official¬† Patreon Help Center here ¬† (Scroll DOWN past the FAQ to get to the different reward tiers) Q:  How much does it cost? A:  Depending on what tier you subscribe to, anything from $1/month + Q:  What does my money go for? A:  Your money goes specifically to supporting my artwork.  This Patreon program is specifically to offset the costs of running my art career, keeping my website and other content \"ad-free,\" paying for bandwidth necessary to give my artwork away to the world and anybody else who wants it, inevitable legal fees, paying the Strangeling staff members, providing salaries to our Strangeling team members, my art supplies, paying utilities and rent for our offices and studios, website administration, and (very importantly) travel expenses so I can come & do art shows, meet my fans, etc.   To see my upcoming schedule of events -¬†¬† Click HERE for upcoming Strangeling Events .   Q:  But don't all the big companies and galleries pay you to come out and have shows? A:  No.  Even if it's a free autograph event halfway around the world where all I do is meet fans for 45 minutes, all travel costs (and hotels, food, etc.) pretty much always come from my own pocket.  I do it because I love it and I love to meet my fans, supporters and friends.  It is pretty much always at a tremendous financial loss.  Patreon can help me offset these costs, and help make it possible for me to come out and see you all more often, I want to travel to more places with my artwork! Q:  So you really get to do what we want with the scans of your public domain paintings?  Even if we're only at the $1 level?¬†¬† A: Yes - everybody can, I have given them to the public.¬† And you Patrons are extra special since you gave me a dollar - you get to download new ones before the muggles do, and loads more perks besides. Q:  So are you not going to post so much at Facebook, Instagram, etc.? A:  I sure am, just as I always do, don't worry!¬† Patreon however will always include ADDITIONAL content that is not going to be available at other sites.¬† Here you can see Patreon Lens videos I post throughout the day (use the free Patreon App - it's the best for watching Lens!) at home or on the road, at the easel or playing with the cats.¬† I keep y'all posted here when I get news, and show you behind-the-scenes stuff I'm not comfortable posting publicly.¬† On my Patreon posts page I preview paintings, announce projects and show off works-in-progress here BEFORE I do so to the general public.  That's part of what you get in exchange for even the smallest token of support, and I thank you dearly. Q:  What is \"Behind the Scenes\" content? A:  This is fun stuff from me, not always very professional, lol, that I don't bother sharing on other sites. I¬† post personal daily videos (often several times a day) with my Patreon Lens (accessible to ALL Patrons $1+, with additional content included in the $5+ tiers).¬† Timelapse videos of paintings from start-to-finish. Livestreams & snippets from my vacations and events, pics from my studio, pictures of me & my cats, pictures of projects I'm working on, pictures of us getting ready to set up our shows and events.  Personal insights that the general public wouldn't probably appreciate, but that you yourself might find interesting!¬†¬† Q:  What is \"Top Secret\" content, and is it really secret? A:  Top Secret really is top secret.  It is for the $50+ tier.  In fact, once you join the tier we will have a short \"NDA\" (Non-Disclosure Agreement) that you will need to agree to.  This is for serious collectors.  This will be the first showings of works-in-progress, and those in the Top Secret tier will thus be the first people to get \"first dibs\" on my infamous First Dibs list.  At that time as well, those in the Top Secret tier can also pre-order Limited Editions / Masterpiece Editions before the general public, which can be crucial.  The Top Secret content will also include full previews of finished original paintings whenever possible before art shows open, which can be a wonderful bonus for those still not having decided on a piece based on the work-in-progress pics.  I will also use the Top Secret content feed to first announce new shows, private projects, pre-orders for new books, stuff not yet suitable for public consumption, etc. Q:  How does the 10% OFF discount work? A:  The 10% OFF discount (available for those in the $10+ tier) is for my website, Strangeling.com (not eBay, not Amazon, not StrangelingUK, not Disney World, only Strangeling.com - but we are working to expand the discount to more Strangeling sites & partners). Shortly after joining this tier, we will contact you with your discount code.  You can use this discount code over & over again, as long as your Patreon membership on my page is viable.  You will need to use the same email address when placing an order with the discount code at Strangeling.com as you do on Patreon (otherwise contact us via Patreon and Jenn or Sonya will hook you up). Q:  What do I get 10% OFF of? A:  You can get 10% off of anything at Strangeling.com - paper prints, Collectible Metal Enamel Pins, Open Edition Canvas prints, Canvas Cuties, Original Sketch Cards, Masterpiece Limited Edition Canvas prints, or even Original Paintings (if I don't sell them off to you Patrons before I finish them, lol).¬† If you even occasionally buy prints, this is an excellent deal for only the $10 tier.  If you were to buy at $595 Masterpiece for example, you'd save almost $60 alone! Q: How does the Pin Collector Tier work? A: ¬†It's one of the best things about Patreon! ¬†Only $25/month for our original members (new members later in 2022 may have to join the New Pin Collector Tier at $35 depending on membership slots available). ¬†If you collect pins, sign up as soon as you can, it is well worth it. ¬†Firstly - you'll get the current Patreon Exclusive Pin (we issue a handful of those each year), not available for sale anywhere else. ¬†Throughout the year, we release additional Patreon Exclusive pins, and whenever we do you'll get those too. ¬†You'll also get items like Strangeling custom pin lanyards.¬† And of course your initial signup includes the current Strangeling Pin of the Month, and also the official Strangeling Logo Pin.¬† Each and every month you'll get the Pin of the Month (usually shipped around the 10th of that month) automatically! ¬†Not only that, you get 10% off any pins you buy from Strangeling.com (and prints, canvases or any other artwork too!). ¬†All shipping worldwide is included.¬† You also get everything that the $10 Patreon level gets, sneak previews, behind the scenes content, early works-in-progress, etc. ¬† If you join the $50+ Tier, in addition to everything above, you'll ALSO be guaranteed to automatically receive one of each of any new/upcoming \"Limited Edition Mini Metal Pin Sets\" (usually $39.99 each) which we issue every few months, and will also receive one of the \"Mystery Pin Sets\" (usually $39.99 each) whenever those are launched at Strangeling.com (depending on inventory we do this a few times a year and they always sell out immediately).¬† This will save you the awful rush and worrying about hitting refresh when the big releases happen, and of course it'll save you money too ;) Q:  Who told you about Patreon? A:  The wonderful and very clever Amanda Palmer.  She recommended it and she has a fantastic Patreon Page too here:¬†¬† Amanda F Palmer's Patreon   Q: Can I really join at the $1 Million tier? A:¬† Yes, I would appreciate it very much.¬† The good folks at Patreon HQ have it set up for me as a real subscription tier, just like the $1 tier. Q: Can I just take your high resolution scans and do what I want with them?¬† Even print stuff and make stuff and sell it?¬† Anywhere?¬† Even if I don't pay you? A:¬† Yes.¬† Anybody can.¬† I've given many of my paintings to the Public Domain.¬† It took me a long time to paint them all though, so if you honestly can spare a dollar or more and show support here at my Patreon, it will help me paint more paintings for you.¬† I love painting.

I'm Foxfeather, and I love vultures!  These underrated and unsung heros of the bird world are in serious trouble and I want to help. I'm on a mission to create a vulture-specific center where these magnificent and important birds can be in the spotlight; a hub for education, research, and conservation work. Though I want to focus specifically on vultures, there is such a big need for\n wildlife rescue and rehabilitation services in my area.¬†As a licensed wildlife rehabilitator and conservation educator, I'm \nworking to develop a wildlife rehab center and network in southern \nMinnesota. Foxloft Conservancy, our wildlife rehabilitation and\n education branch, is now a registered 501c3 non-profit organization!  My goal through my art, education, and rehabilitation effort is to help better connect \npeople with and animals and the natural world. Through live shows with our education ambassador birds (like Sev, pictured above) and online events, I hope to inspire a greater interest in conservation and wildlife stewardship; for vultures and all of our wild neighbors. Your patronage allows \nme to do this work; to feed the birds, build facilities, care for wildlife patients, and to offer programs for free to schools and \ncommunity groups in my area. You also get to follow along with the process of developing a wildlife center from the ground up, along with other perks of being a patron!  On top of the wildlife work, I'm also an artist and run a small farm. I'm a beekeeper, falconer, yak-wrangler, and am owned-by-emus. Along with Patreon, you can keep up to date with my adventures on  Twitter  or on my websites,  Foxloft Studios  and  Foxloft Conservancy How Does Patreon Work? Please think of Patreon as a tip-jar or supportive membership service. If you enjoy my work, have laughed at my crazy emu videos, or want to toss the ambassador kestrel, raven, or vultures a mouse, this is a way to show your appreciation and support. Lots of people think wildlife rehab is paid for by the state or \ngovernment; it is not. I am completely reliant on self-funding and \ndonations to pay vet bills, buy medical equipment and specialty diets, \nbuild housing for and spend the time caring for orphaned and injured \nwildlife. You can directly help my work grow and succeed! If you join me as a patron, you get access to my library of posts and articles as well as new ones emailed to you monthly. You can turn these notifications on or off and enjoy them at your leisure.  You can have a direct impact on helping the Vulture Center become a reality!  Patreon offers the ability to become a supporter of the work that you love. By pledging even just $1 a month you can help keep me rescuing wildlife, making new artwork, spreading the word about conservation, and sustainable farming - with additional benefits listed below!  Being a patron gets you access to exclusive work-in-progress artwork and behind the scenes with the animals!  I share lots of stories about what it's like to work with and raise ambassador birds, rescue wildlife, and live with critters around the farm. I'm sharing what it's like to develop shows and programs, care for the outreach animals, and work in wildlife rehabilitation. If you've ever been curious about this work, you're in the right place!  If you'd like to see how some of my art designs are created, from concept to \nfinal design, all levels of patronage offer the chance to see my \nprogress artwork, including sketches and process art as well as a sneak \npeak at the designs I'll be working on before anyone else knows, and early access to fun projects like Kickstarter campaigns. Thank you so much for considering backing my work!  I can't tell you how much it means to me, all the support I've gotten from so many amazing people who have helped me to help animals and to make a career out of doing what I'm passionate about.

Sharing videos, ideas, supporting each other through tough stuff, making jokes, brainstorming on my new video ideas... IT'S. AWESOME.¬† How many videos will I get charged for a month? Your support ties to one video a week. I release videos every other Friday to our main channel and every Monday to our Fitness Outrageous channel! I only charge for one a week, no matter what.

My name is Emma Carlisle and I'm an illustrator living in the South West of England. I'm sure most of you have found this Patreon page via my Instagram account where I share my love of sketchbooks, landscape paintings and life drawing - Hello! Welcome! Nice to meet you! I've been posting on Instagram for nearly 10 years however since the start of 2018 I've been using it to document my creative journey as I've transitioned away from picture books and towards a more experimental approach to image making. I gave myself time to develop as an artist and it's been the most rewarding and healing experience. Instagram has been the perfect place for me to document this journey and if you follow me already you'll know I try to be as honest and open as possible, recently I've found myself holding back especially with behind the scenes work, process' and sketchbook tours, there's only so much I can do and only so much time I have which is where I feel Patreon steps in and becomes the prefect complimentary platform for sharing my practice.  The most important thing to me is that I've grown an Instagram following which feels like a community, a space for me to share new work and get instant supportive feedback from what feels like an amazing group of friends (although there's over 55k of you now! eek!) Every comment, like and message gives me the assurance that I'm on the right track (even when I try something completely new) and this has made me feel confident about continuing to develop as an artist.  I feel honored that you follow me on social media and I'm even more so that you've made it this far and are considering backing me on Patreon, seriously, thank you so much!  When I sat down and thought about what I'd like this page to be it was really simple - I wanted to be able to give back some of the support you've given me and help you grow as an artist too, which is why each tier is designed to offer some level of guidance and encouragement. I want us to work together to create something exciting, where we can both share the highs and the lows. Whether you're picking up a pencil for the first time, starting a new project, wanting to change your style or just want someone to draw along with I'm hoping there will be something for everyone.  If you'd like to support me please choose the monthly pledge that best suits you - but please don't worry you can edit or cancel this at any time.

By supporting me through patreon I will be able to focus on making more of my own content without having to take on additional side projects. The support from this club will also help me fund more future projects of my own! Leftover items from each month will be added to the secret shop at their\n retail value. People will only be able to purchase them through the \nsecret shop by using the monthly password that I will distribute at the \nfirst of each month alongside the monthly discount code. Passwords and discounts are distributed on the 5th of each month after payments have processed. Thank you if you decide to join!\n\t\t\\(^„ÉÆ^)/\n How my patreon works  Each month there are new designs available for sign up.  For pins tiers you can add a sticker sheet add on for an extra $2. The design will not be the same, it is a different design each month and its usually something from my IG gallery.  Payments are only processed on the 1st of each month so you have a whole month to decide whether to stay or leave.  Payments are processed from the 1st ‚Äì 5th of each month so do not panic if you do not see a charge yet.  Rewards are shipped out  only when production for them has finished .  On average it usually takes 2 months for production and shipping but sometimes delays may happen.  For pin clubs I‚Äôm offering 2 pins for each pin tier (unless you pick combo), there is twice the work so I give myself enough time for packing and shipping.  Originally, I only had one pin per tier and the mini pin was a bonus I had for being late. Now it is a permanent addition in exchange for the longer wait time.  I am not using a fulfillment center nor am I a group of people. It is just me grading and packaging pins so I appreciate the patience! Secret Shop and Discounts  Passwords are sent out on the 5th of each month.  Past rewards are added to the shop but ONLY if I have leftovers.  You can only get fan club pins in the secret shop from now on.  I can not ship to the EU or UK through my main shop (does not affect patreon). I can only through Etsy. There are a lot of inconvenient new laws so aside from enamel pins other items may be hard to get. It is not me making these rules! :U Before joining, please keep these notes in mind! ¬∞Àñ‚úß Shipping ‚úßÀñ¬∞ All tiers have shipping calculated into the price International orders also have tracking but may vary depending on country Goods will be shipped when rewards come in (times may vary) For international orders, in order for me to keep prices low I have opted for a cheaper shipping option .  I have also included $1 insurance for all international packages Please note that I cannot combine patreon orders with shop orders.

GUYS CAN YOU PLEASE READ THE PINNED POST BEFORE YOU SAY YOU CAN'T FIND MY ANIMATIONS. Thank you. <3 Hey there! It's  Tail-Blazer. Let me start by saying this Patreon is on a Pay Upfront charging basis. When you become a patron, your pledge is immediately taken in instead of being taken on the 1st of each month. After your initial pledge is taken, you'll be charged around every 1st of the month. So it's best to become a patron earlier in the month so you're not charged unnecessarily. Thank You! ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I take a traditional approach to Patreon. I treat it like a virtual tip jar with some minor perks. I think of Patreon as more of a tip jar than a \"I gave you money so do these things\" ... jar. However there are some tier rewards for becoming a patron. 5 dollars gets you full access to my explicit content and the ability to vote on monthly art packs and view unreleased animations, as well as early access to said packs. 10 dollars get you the ability to suggest an sketched drawing for me to do. Both tiers gain you early access. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I also don't post daily. People seem surprised by this. However, I do post in clumps, usually a couple times a month. When I finished the requests for the month, I'll post all of it or half of them. Same with the art packs and whatnot. I'm always working, but don't be surprised if you don't see me post until later in the month. I notice some people are suggesting full-on, multiple panel drawings. This isn't what the suggestion box is for. If you'd like that much detail, you can commission it. I'm not doing commission work for close to nothing. The suggestions are always rougher and faster than commission work. For anyone wondering what my work has been in the past to get a feel for what it can be in the future, here is a link :  Tail-Blazer DeviantArt Anyway. I know you guys are anxious for art.

There's really no extra content that's posted here, it's just a way to support me if you'd like or to get your name at the end of one of my videos. If you're here to donate and support my creative efforts, I really appreciate it! I also feel like I should let you know that I accept donations over on  my Twitch page  as well, where I read messages aloud and get to interact a bit more. There's also a Discord server that you're able to join if you subscribe to me on Twitch for $5. Just wanted to let you know of that option before you committed to Patreon. Anyway thank you very much for even visiting this page in the first place! There's absolutely no obligation for you to donate, just so we're clear.

I mainly work in the intersection between food and poverty, whether that's creating recipes on shoestring budgets based on my own experiences as a single mum and former food bank user, or writing about current affairs - whether that's food banks, cooking, access to food, prices, farming, etc. Many years ago when I (accidentally) started out as a food writer, several well-meaning people in television or food or books individually took me aside and said 'Jack, you need to choose between being a food writer or being a political campaigner'. Literally a dozen people said this to me in a short period of time. And I refused - because my food writing came from a place of hunger and poverty in one of the richest economies in the world, and I can't detach cheap recipes from the reasons why people need them in the first place. I'd be a much more palatable (and higher earning!) food writer if I just STFU about inequality and injustice, but that's not my style. By supporting my Patreon you're giving me space to create the work that really drives me - the free recipes on my website and allllll the admin work that that entails, the charity work I do for free for dozens of food organisations and NGOs tackling poverty, the school talks, the good stuff that makes a difference but doesn't pay the bills. It's not a donation service, there's a reward at every tier, so it's more like a subscription for some goodies as well as exclusive behind the scenes content, musings, sneak peeks at upcoming bits and pieces, and more.

Mid-Month bonus page coming soon for Silver + ;) About: Welcome to my page, I'm really glad you're here! I've been an artist professionally since 2006 and am very blessed to have many fans that have followed me since the very beginning, collecting original art, prints, and products. Many of you may have just discovered my work recently, through my coloring books and pages, which is what I am most recognized for. The way I connect with fans through my art over the years has morphed into this unexpected and amazing fan-artist collaboration through the adult coloring world. I draw the pictures, and you put your artistic flare into it by bringing it to life with color. You no longer have to be an \"artist\" to take advantage of the benefits art can provide you. I can't tell you how exciting it is to get to share this experience with all of you, because art has literally SAVED me in my life by allowing me to escape to an imaginary, colorful, world of dreams where everything is possible. When I create, whether drawing, painting, or coloring, it feels like I have been swept away to another dimension, and time just floats away. Fans all over the world of all backgrounds, ages, and skill levels are finding great joy, peace, fun, relaxation--and an uplifting community--through what I have always treasured deep in my soul--ART. Art gives. Art connects. Art lives. Art breathes. Art heals. Art is expression. Art is emotion. Art is MAGIC...and it's just what the world needs now :). It's no wonder to me it's become such a popular hobby! I've been providing coloring pages for adults to color for long before the \"coloring craze\" hit--since around 2008, which is over 10 years now. I've sold over 200,000 copies of my coloring books and countless more digital pages in just the last few years. Coloring pages are my jam! Join me in bringing new, fresh Hannah Lynn Whimsy Girl coloring pages every month to the coloring community by collaborating with me and connecting with other fans in this fascinating world where artists and colorists collide!¬† The pages created for this group are created from start to finish with all of you in mind, by hand. They are only available during the current month, are not available as \"back pages\" for any price, and will never be in a publication or be licensed onto products. They are truly exclusive and just for you as a supporter during the current month! Once you have the PDF file you can print them off as many times as you like and enjoy them for years to come, but by signing up you agree that will not share them with others (sharing colored pages is allowed on social media or as a gift to someone, but sharing uncolored pages with others is against copyright--I retain all copyrights as the artist for these artworks). CHARGE UP FRONT so you don't miss out --This is a \"charge up front\" account. Because the rewards are exclusive to each month with no ability to get back issued rewards, you will be charged (and rewarded) on the day you sign up (even if it's the last day of the month)--and then recurring charges will be scheduled on the first of each month. So, if you sign up on the 28th for example, you will be charged (with that month's rewards sent to you) that day, and then the next charge will occur just a few days later on the first of the following month, and then on the first every month thereafter. This ensures everyone is on the same payment schedule and that each month's rewards are accounted for and delivered properly. I am eternally grateful for the support everyone has given me along the way--I wouldn't be where I am today without all of you! Thank you for making my dreams come true!

May I call you  Beastling ? You are most likely here because you love music, animals, various forms of art or maybe all of the above. Well, you've come to the right place! How does it work? I've set up 6 tiers that offer a wide range of options so you can choose the one that suits you best! All tiers are cumulative so each tier contains all the benefits of the previous tiers. The  Song of the Season  is available to all tiers; the Merch for Membership is available to Iron, Platinum and Blue Beastlings. More information can be found about it ¬† here . When I launched this Fan Club I could never have imagined the impact it would have. We are a¬† community  of art lovers and artists supporting and inspiring one another. Knowing there is a receptive audience that appreciates my work  directly  motivates me to grow as a vocalist, try new media, hone my skills and expand my field of work. I love touring the world with Arch Enemy and I hope the state of the planet will soon allow for this again! Making music is my life and, as such, composing and performing music devours my days and years at a blinding speed. It's been almost two decades, now, of losing my mind on metal stages and I am so fortunate to have amassed an amazing, compassionate, unique community of fans over the years. I wanted to make an official place for us to convene, so here we are. Why? I truly want to be singing and screaming original songs on stage for as long as I am breathing! That being said, the music industry is quite different nowadays; musicians have to tour a lot more now than we used to to compensate for the change in market from purchasing albums to streaming them for free. Songwriters are really  not  fairly compensated anymore, so much so that there are all sorts of laws churning up to change that so the world doesn't end up music-less. Albums cost a LOT of money and time for those making them! Luckily, I love touring and - don't get me wrong - I want you to enjoy the music I make however you feel most comfortable; at home and hopefully at live concerts too! We do our very best to perform as far and wide across the Earth as possible.    This, however, means I am  always  on tour and have very little time to devote to writing new material (for both Arch Enemy and ALISSA). Not to mention  The Song of the Season  and all the painting, sculpting,¬† poetry,   photography  and film projects scratching their way out of my brain! For example, I would really like to be able to create music and music-videos that are extremely personal with my ALISSA solo project; I got to deliver a small taste of that with the¬† Lizzie music video . How? I've decided to connect directly with you - the amazing fans (the Beastlings) who are already such an important part of my life - right here on Patreon. This is a way that you can DIRECTLY support me as an artist; no labels taking a cut, no agents, no bullshit. Just you and me. You can decide which tier works for you and your presence is tremendously important no matter which tier you choose. This community is a safe space for us where we can feel confident in expressing ourselves, promoting causes we believe in and sharing our thoughts without worry of crazed internet judgement (very, VERY long-time fans might recall that this was the format of my Facebook page for many years). This Fan Club will be more private, sort of like attending one of my club shows where I can high-five you from stage versus a giant outdoor festival with hundreds of thousands of people attending. I also want to have an open line of communication so we can build this community together; it's not only about me, it's about  us .    I've now set up 6 membership packages that I think will be fun for you and give you a lot of options. I will continue to take your feedback into consideration to make this community as mutually rewarding as possible. The beauty is that this whole thing is completely optional - YOU decide if you want to join and how much you would like to pledge and every pledge is greatly appreciated. I can't say it enough -  thank you  for keeping music alive! Now. Real Talk. The awkward part nobody wants to mention.    This part is going to suck so let's just get through it together.  Listen: I know talking about money is a bummer. It actually grosses me out. I have never been good at asking for money for my art. I've done most of my work for free (even now, 18 years in) just because it is  so  hard to even perceive that oneself might actually import a  value . The unfortunate reality is that we are all human, we all have bills to pay, unexpected medical emergencies, families to support, regular boring bullshit nobody wants to acknowledge. But there is no magical \"making it\" ledge you jump off into a world of wealth and luxury when you are an artist. Bills don't suddenly disappear. No dude in a suit shows up, shakes your hand and gives you a briefcase full of money. Fame and followers do not equal dollars and banks don't accept instagram likes as a form of currency. \"Making it\" just means you get the opportunity to work longer and harder... and I am always up for that challenge and burst through any door or window that is ajar.  Advertising  is  a widely accepted way to generate income for tv and radio shows, podcasts, youtube videos, etc. We don't even notice ads because we are so used to them but they rob us of our valuable time. It's not in my nature to advertise things I don't care about. I don't want to become a product. I want to remain myself, remain an artist. I think I will respect myself a lot more earning pledges directly from those who appreciate what I create rather than selling myself out. Exhale.    So,  here it is . The venue is packed. The lights dim. The show is about to start.  Are you front row?  This is it, Beastlings.

A system where only the biggest of the big bands are able to make a living and the rest of us sacrifice our whole lives and risk financial ruin every step of the way. \n So where to from here? Well, we want to create an interactive fan experience unlike any band that has come before us.  \n We want to help create a path, not just for Ne Obliviscaris, but for the countless bands across the world that are working incredibly hard, touring the world to perform for their fans and losing money every step of the way.  \n And we want to do it by empowering YOU, the fans, so that you get to decide who succeeds and who doesn‚Äôt. The old establishment is dying. Let‚Äôs show that we can create our own new way forward and put the power back where it should be, with the fans who love and believe in the music that we, and so many great bands out there are creating. \n To start with though, we want to give you guys a bit more background on the reality of our situation, and then we‚Äôll explain exactly how you can get involved in our career in an unprecedented new way.  \n THE EFFECT OF THE INTERNET ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†Rather than fight the inevitable change that the industry has had thrust upon it ever since the advent of the internet in the mid 90's, here in NeO we are always embracing new ways forward. NeO first built an underground following across the world in large part due to the benefits of file sharing, torrents, youtube and the internet in general. We didn't have a huge label spending tens of thousands of dollars trying to make us the next big thing; it was a grass roots thing... Fans discovered us, told their friends, discussed NeO on forums; they shared our music with each other and helped spread our music to more and more people over time.  \n The internet has resulted in an industry that actually gives more bands an opportunity to build a decent fanbase, as the music is now available for everyone to listen to anytime they want - for free. Lots of people in the industry refer to the ‚Äúgood old days‚Äù when everyone bought albums and many bands made a lot of money, but in some ways, it is much more democratic this way. Instead of it being like the old days where the only bands that could become successful were the one's that had the support of a big label, these days it is YOU, the people out there that decide which bands succeed or fail. The bands that get signed at all are often the ones that have acquired fans at a grass roots level and forced the labels to take notice, not the other way around. That is what happened with NeO and is happening with many other bands.  FINANCIAL REALITIES IN THIS NEW INDUSTRY The one downside¬†is that though a band like us owes much of our popularity to the internet and the way the industry works in 2016, the industry no longer supports bands financially in the way it used to. The harsh reality is that you now have bands that have tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of fans all around the world, and yet still make less than minimum wage. \n We'll level with you...here in NeO we don‚Äôt even make that. In fact we have never been paid anything for playing in this band, as the little money we do make gets continually re-invested to finance all our tours rather than paid out to members.  \n The first time we ever made a profit on a tour was our 2014 Citadel Australian Launch tour. All up we made just over $20,000AUD. This was an incredible result for us at the time and it might sound like a lot‚Ä¶ Until you realise that since then we have done 3 major international tours lasting between 4 and 7 weeks each, and lost AT LEAST $20,000AUD on every single one of them.  \n \n THE AUSTRALIAN FACTOR Things are tough for bands all across the world right now, but realistically part of this is because we are from Australia. We start every tour having to pay $10-15,000AUD in flights to some far-off part of the world (they all are pretty far off, to be honest...), plus Visa's, Bus Deposits, Merchandise (T-Shirts, Hoodies, CD's, Vinyl etc.) which can still cost many thousands of dollars despite getting them at wholesale price and more. As a result, we may start a tour with over $30,000 in debt, and then hope that we make enough money each day on the tour to start chipping away at this total so that we can afford to do another tour after that one.  TOUR INCOME/EXPENSES BREAKDOWN FOR OUR LAST EUROPEAN TOUR To be more specific, on our Oct/Nov 2015 European Tour with Cradle of Filth our total gross income from Performance Fees and Merchandise Sales for the 33 shows combined was $46,789AUD.  \n Once again, that probably sounds like a lot until you realise that when you add up our international flights, bus hire for 6 1/2 weeks, petrol, tolls, UK Work Visa's, UK wireless permits, Ferries, Merchandise, Booking Agent Fees, Sound Engineer, Backline Hire & more we had more than $67,433AUD in expenses.  \n So the final result from that tour was a LOSS of $20,644AUD ($14,625USD/13,504 Euro) and honestly that is with us doing quite well compared to many other bands.  THE HUGE IMPACT OF THE WORLD TOUR CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGN The reason that we are doing better than most is in large part due to our amazingly supportive fan base that contributed over $86,000AUD to our World Tour crowd funding campaign in mid-2014. That campaign was so successful that it did exactly what we hoped it would do, it gave us the start up cash to tour all around the world and play for so many of you guys! Since then we have toured through Europe, Asia, India, Middle East, Australia and now finally here we are in North America. It has been the ride of a lifetime and we have decided once and for all that this is what we want to do with our lives.  \n Many bands have to pick and choose where they can afford to tour, but we wanted to try and play for as many of you as possible and YOU guys helped make that happen. The only issue is that simply doing one tour of Europe or North America or Asia doesn't all of a sudden make you a big success in these markets. The bands that are successful come back over and over again - so that‚Äôs what we want to do.  But the reality is that our losses mean that our current level of commitment to the band is unsustainable and so we have been trying to work out how to stay on the road so we can keep performing for you guys as often as possible.   \n So while the crowd funding campaign was a huge success and did exactly what we needed it to do, the limitation of a campaign in that setting is that it is designed to fund a particular project (in our case a world tour) and then once the project is done, the money is gone. We‚Äôve often been asked in interviews what we would do after the crowd funding money was gone. Would we crowd fund our next world tour as well? And the response from us was always the same‚Ä¶we‚Äôd have to wait and see what felt right when the time came. \n \n REALITY CHECK A few weeks ago we started our USA tour with $36AUD in the bank and about $25,000 in debt due to the massive up front costs of international touring, plus some unpaid bills from our European tour in Oct/Nov. \n If this current tour is a success we can get some of that money back, but we are treading an extremely fine line now between giving ourselves the best opportunity to tour and make new fans, and going broke. \n To make things even more precarious, in the past few months,  all of us  have lost our primary day jobs back home. Dan left his job as a train driver as they refused to give him more time off work to tour, Tim‚Äôs job as a violin teacher at a school back in Melbourne didn't work out anymore seeing he was rarely there, and while Matt managed to keep a job he had to downgrade to casual, meaning he‚Äôs had to do some insane financial juggling to be able to pay his mortgage so that his wife and two kids were going to be ok while we‚Äôre away on this tour. In general everyone in the band is facing significant financial hardship. \n The reality is that there is a gap in the industries ability to provide enough revenue for a band like us,¬†and as a result, we are stuck in a situation where we tour too much to hold down a normal day job, but at the same time aren‚Äôt getting paid for playing in the band. \n \n WE WANT TO DO THIS FULL TIME We love playing in this band, and we'll be straight with you, we want to do this full time. It is extremely difficult to hold down any sort of normal job with the amount of touring we are doing at the moment and that leaves us with only two options: 1. Find a way that we can start making a profit and get paid for what we do in NeO, so that we can continue to pursue this as a full-time endeavour and tour the world on a regular basis. OR 2. Cut back on how seriously we are taking the band and instead just do it as a hobby and maybe do one big international tour every 2 years. \n \n WHAT ABOUT DOING IT FOR THE LOVE? Nobody playing in a metal band, let alone a band as unique as ours is doing it for the money, but the reality is that Tim's 3 year old daughter, Matt's wife and two kids, and Dan's mortgage - any of these real life concerns don't get paid by the love and affection of people who enjoy our music.  \n The only reason we do this IS for the love of it¬†and that is why we want to do this full time. In the last 10 months, we have spent 5 of them on the road not getting paid a dime. If you can imagine what it would be like to try and survive the next year if almost half of that time you had no job and no income whatsoever then you can understand that regardless of how amazing it is to tour the world, that you can‚Äôt survive long term with so little money. \n Realistically, this is an issue that affects thousands of bands across the world; it‚Äôs just that nobody likes to talk about it. However we strongly feel that if given the opportunity, many fans would be willing to help fund the future of the bands that are creating music they love, and so we want to put that belief into practice. \n \n A NEW WAY FORWARD IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY We wouldn‚Äôt have been able to take that next step in our career without the massive support we have received from our fans. But with the crowd funding money long gone and enormous touring opportunities on the horizon, for a while now we have been trying to work out what to do next.  \n What we are asking of NeO fans is a small ongoing commitment; to become patrons of Ne Obliviscaris through a new platform called Patreon, where you can contribute as little or as much as you want on a monthly basis: \n \n www.patreon.com/neobliviscaris \n In return, as well as the knowledge that you are directly supporting and financing the music and career of a band you like, we are also going to be creating a host of new content available exclusively to our Patreon members. Some of this content includes exclusive and/or early access to: \n New NeO music, interactive tour video diaries, exclusive merch ranges, pre-sale ticket options, giveaways and competitions, tour podcasts, feature band interviews, Drum, Bass, Violin & Guitar video tutorials from NeO members, live online chats with the band, live video streaming of NeO rehearsals, access to exclusive cover song recordings & more. PLUS VIP levels that include benefits such as free tickets to shows, phone calls from members upon signing up or on your birthday, personal thank you in the liner notes of our next album, side of stage access at shows and even the ability to help choose our set list when we play in your town. \n It is the fans that have the power to decide which bands are successful. Every band that earns a living from their music does so financed by their fanbase, regardless of how many middlemen jump into the mix to dilute the money pool. What we are doing, cuts out all the middlemen and provides a direct way for fans to support NeO in an ongoing fashion. \n If you would like to live in a world where an Australian progressive extreme metal band with a violinist can actually make a living from their music so that they can dedicate themselves 100% to creating the best music and tour the world as often as possible, then this is for you.  \n No band has ever done something quite like this before‚Ä¶ so let‚Äôs make history together.  - NeO ***************** We want to create an interactive fan experience unlike any other band before us and we need YOUR help to pull this off.  So please, sign up and show your support for us and for this new way forward in the music industry -- and make sure you send through your comments and ideas to help us give you, and all our incredible fans across the world, the best possible value for your contribution. Please note : While some rewards will be delivered every single month, others may only happen when on tour, or in between tours, every couple of months. We have tried to specify where possible, but feel free to contact us with any questions.

I‚Äôve been helping other artists through my blog and Youtube channel for years, and because there is so much interest in pastel tuition, I thought I‚Äôd try to devote more time and energy to video tutorials. This is where you guys come in‚Ä¶ By using Patreon as a forum to share this knowledge, you can contribute with a subscription to help me fund this project.¬† With your support you‚Äôll gain access to  video tutorials, royalty free reference photos, instructional videos, Paint Along demos and more.  All while in the knowledge that you're helping me upgrade my equipment and improve my content. My own background in art starts at an early age with the discovery of pastel and a love for painting animals. I graduated as an Illustrator in 2007 but since then I have produced hundreds of portraits, both pets and people. I also love to paint landscapes, cityscapes, seascapes, interior scenes, whatever inspires me. It‚Äôs all about the light for me. There is no better medium to capture it all than pastel. I‚Äôll show you from the basics, right through to capturing the finest detail. I'll also provide practical advice on how to make it as an artist if you want to turn your hobby into your career. I have different levels of subscription to suit all budgets. ¬†Patreon is simple‚Ä¶you can subscribe for as long as you want and it‚Äôs really easy to cancel or pause at any time.

My creative story starts way back in the 1970s before I was born. My parents received a most original wedding present; one guest took their wedding invitation, painted a watercolour scene over the top and sent it back to them as a wedding gift - I grew up with that painting hung on my wall. Through my twenties I enjoyed a varied creative career first as a set and costume designer, then as a stylist and illustrator. I kept searching for the heart and soul in my creative pursuits and the thought of my parent's watercolour wedding stationery inspired me to launch de Winton Paper co.  I started my watercolour wedding stationery business in 2015 and along the way I've also become a watercolour teacher, commissioned artist and¬† published author ! I am sure that this series of transformations came from sharing my work and process on social media and benefiting from being part of a creative community. I've shared my paintings, stationery commissions and tutorials primarily on¬† Instagram  - which is where I imagine most of you found me. Whilst 2020 threw my traditional methods of making a living off course, it also provided me with time, inspiration and a renewed appreciation for the creative people I've connected with on social media. Watercolour provides us with a mindful escape as well as a source of creativity and I am so passionate to sustain that feeling of happy calm. There is nothing better than putting brush to paper for a few hours and losing yourself in the watery wonder of watercolour.¬†In Spring of 2020¬†Ant and I teamed together to start a¬† Youtube channel : him on all production, me in front of the camera. We're having a great time creating tutorials and meeting a whole new audience. Your curiosity has helped me realise the value in sharing more of my process: all¬†the sketch book pages, experimentation with materials and general creative musings that I've kept to myself are invaluable in their contribution to making me the artist I am today. ¬†I would love to share all of this with you to enhance your watercolour painting experience. I am so grateful to have built a watercolour community on both¬† Instagram  and¬† Youtube . I cherish every comment and take a genuine interest in how watercolour and creativity has provided a lifeline for many of you. It's amazing to hear your stories and I feel indebted to you for allowing me to make this my job. A Patreon page will ensure that I can build upon this foundation of online watercolour content and be able to give something back to all of you who have encouraged me and given me so much guidance along the way. ¬†On my Patreon site you'll get bonus content related to my weekly YouTube videos and current painting commissions. Each tier is designed to offer a level of watercolour guidance whether you're new to watercolour or a seasoned painter. If you'd like to support me (thank you!) please choose the monthly pledge that best suits you. You can edit or cancel your pledge at any time.

The strips exist online for free, and I absolutely intend to keep it that way.¬† However...¬†I'm not gonna turn my nose up at any kind support from my wonderful readers . I assure you that any contributions you make will go right back into the comic (at least the part not going to feed my small army of pets) helping me to create even more content for you to enjoy. My hope is to one day create books and other comic related merchandise and you wonderful Patrons can help that happen!¬† Most of all I just want to thank everyone who reads the comics and vigorously thank any of you who choose to support my work.

The Shadowscapes Tarot was one of the early projects I took on, and the first where I decided to follow my own desires and art instincts. I also am the author of the Dreamscapes series of watercolor technique books.\n \n \nOver the years, I've loved sharing how I do what I do with you, my audience. I mean this with regards to creative inspiration, running an art business, and in technical tricks and materials. I love knowing that my own passion can inspire other people to find and succeed in their own passions as well. It is rewarding to hear from people across the entire spectrum, from non-artists who just want insight into creative processes, to students and teachers coming across Dreamscapes in their libraries, to aspiring young artists who in turn have now become professionals as well.\n \n \n \n \n\"More Videos!\"\n \n \nThe internet and technology is always evolving, and so in recent years one of the requests I've heard the most often is for \"More Videos!\" This has always been tricky for me as it is disruptive to my workflow, and can be awkward to paint with a camera in front of me. Video editing is also very time consuming. I \n want  to be able to create videos for you, because I'd love to be able to share a more real-time and in-depth view of some of my processes.  \n \n \n \nBeing open and sharing my knowledge with the world has always been important, and I want to keep as much of that free and accessible as possible; but I hope with your help here on Patreon to be able to create much more instructional content than I would otherwise be able to do. With patron funds, and with your interaction and input, I'd love to explore and play with techniques and have you help decide what direction to go with these tutorials -- showing content that you tell me you'd like to see so that we can move forward collaboratively! After a one month delay I will release most of the instructional videos to the public as well, because as I said, it is very important to me to continue being able to reach young artists, students, and people who have little access to these resources, but your support here will be key to having this material happen in the first place. \n \n \n \n \n What else? \n \nAnother benefit of being a patron will be access to some of the raw sketches and stages of my painting. Let's face it, social media is a very curated experience. As artists, we have to be mindful of the fact that everything we show on a \n Facebook  page or  Instagram  is viewed not only by artists, but by potential clients, galleries, and publishers. As such, we can't ever show \"the ugly phase\" of a painting or those less than photogenic steps that nevertheless might reveal a lot about the thought process and decisions that go into the creation. I'll take you behind the scenes and give you first glimpses of new material that hasn't been released to the public, secret projects in the works, as well as first opportunity when it comes to access to my original paintings. \n \n \nThanks for stopping by!\n \n \n- Stephanie\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t \n \n The Rewards: \n \n \n $1 / Through the Looking Glass \n \n Thank you for being part of this endeavor!

Existen podcasts/videos que aparecen en Dixo, Spotify, Apple y YouTube; art√≠culos period√≠sticos, en El Financiero; participaciones televisivas en Dinero y Poder; y ocasionalmente entrevistas. Ninguno de esos espacios se presta a un an√°lisis detallado, ni econ√≥mico ni pol√≠tico/social, que es lo que aqu√≠ puedo ofrecer.

En materia econ√≥mica, desde las agencias internacionales y nacionales hasta los bancos y grupos financieros, pasando por  think tanks  que afortunadamente han florecido en M√©xico, de gran calidad.

Es importante que esta aportaci√≥n corresponda con la que ustedes hacen, y s√≥lo ustedes pueden saberlo. Por esa raz√≥n, les solicito que sean tan amables de se√±alar los puntos que puedan mejorarse, criticar las fallas, proponer ideas. Si esta p√°gina no aporta valor, tendr√° que desaparecer, algo que no deseo que ocurra al menos durante la pr√≥xima d√©cada.

I‚Äôm an artist currently based in Somerset, UK. After finishing my fine art degree I felt lost and eventually began teaching. But something was missing so, several years ago, I gave up my home and career to slow travel around Europe. This completely changed my perspective and gave me the opportunity to concentrate on making art and working fearlessly in my art journals. My process took me on a magnificent and transformational journey where I experienced creativity as a healing medicine. I now love to share my heart-felt journaling process and painting techniques here in this special community of creative souls. I do what I love because I truly believe, creativity heals the soul. Having your company and support truly means the world to me, and, whichever tier you join, for whatever amount of time, I appreciate every single one of you. Xx Thank you so much!

What will my pelts be used for, and what of the hunts in the Upper Country? The main reason to donate is to afford me the ability to work on these projects full-time, and even the smallest donations help.¬† I also use these donations to expand the scope of what I'm able to do- I've used the funds collected so far to purchase a capture card, software, texture library subscriptions, games to review, and materials for bits I wouldn't have done otherwise, like a twerking claymation Tingle.¬† That happened. The Bay of Fundy is rich and wild, and the boldest of coureur des bois have grown fat from its bounty Don't you also receive revenue from YouTube?¬† Will your shocking greed never be satiated? My essays very frequently use excerpts from other channels or copyrighted music that disqualifies them from monetization.¬† I could omit these materials but I think that would reduce the quality of the videos and the effectiveness of the comparisons I make.¬† As it is, I only monetize the handful of video essays that are primarily based on my own captures (texture progress videos are never monetized).¬†  YouTube also doesn't provide as much as most people probably believe...¬† This is the amount earned by my Resident Evil 3 review in its first month: I wanted stars and did not get stars How often will new content be posted?

I'll continue making content even without any support, but your donations will help improve the pace and the quality. What will I get in return? In addition to helping me work on material, donating any amount will get you my thanks and the ability to participate in polls, suggest the subject of future videos, and a special Discord role to let everyone know you mean business.¬† Anyone brave enough to donate $5 or more will have their name included at the end of every video,* documenting their importance and heroism for all time. *Terms and restrictions apply.¬† Do not choose a name that is offensive, or so dumb that it's stupid.

We create adult games and artwork, with strong dystopian themes, as well as more light-hearted content like webcomics! Our work frequently covers dark, and often debauched settings, ranging from high fantasy worlds ravaged by the tragedies of war and plague, to post-apocalyptic cities plagued by infected horrors, famine, and corrupt authorities. If these sound like things you'd be into, then without any further ado, please check out some of the content that we've been working on, shown below! --- [ ADULT GAMES ] When we first started the Dystopian Project, there was a scarcity of \"real\" adult games out there. Most adult games were little more than slideshows, with little in the way of gameplay or writing. Sometimes, even the art wasn't original. We aimed to change that! Since our inception, we've gone on to have a track record for completing adult games, with the fully-finished title, Overgrown: Genesis, under our belt and published on Steam as of May 2020, thanks largely to the continued support of our patrons!¬† Regarding adult game development, our goal is always to combine compelling stories with gorgeous artwork, backed by gameplay elements designed to complement the dark and kinky content, rather than detract from it, as so many games make the mistake of doing! As such, we often make use of a variety of unorthodox settings and characters! For instance, in¬†one of our games, you can play as a refugee in a dark fantasy world, but atypically for such a setting, you play a peasant girl with zero combat ability, far from the \"hero that saves the world\". As a result, you must rely solely on quick wit, observation skills, stealth, and other non-combat traits in order to survive in a harsh new world plagued by all manner of evils. In another game, you play as the spunky survivor of a zombie apocalypse, potentially armed to the teeth, and ready to take on anything with sheer grit alone.¬†However, you will soon find it much easier to conserve your supplies and weaponry, and to sneak past a threat rather than going in guns blazing.  You'll also find people in power that will send you on dangerous fetch quests in exchange for their aid... But who would be just as willing to help you if you meekly got on your knees, stuck out your tongue, and submitted to¬†them as their plaything. In our games, we like to feature well-rounded female heroines who, when confronted with difficult situations, can either kick ass, stealthily sneak past the obstacle, or outright succumb to the depravity that surrounds them...  ... And, depending on how you, the player, have built up their personality over the course of their journey, you might find they even  enjoy  the indignity of it all.¬† Their choices are many, and their ultimate fate is in the hands of you, the player. Will you have the heroine make a noble last stand, or take the easy way out, and give in to oppression? We pride ourselves in going the extra mile to really make the adult games we work on stand out as actual  games,  rather than glorified hentai galleries.  To do that, we make use of unique assets in areas like our overworlds and item inventories that are all drawn from scratch, and use customized user interfaces specifically tailored to suit our unorthodox gameplay styles. We also put painstaking effort into characters portraits, setting design, and even on original music and sound effects! If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, consider pledging to us and ¬† becoming a patron ¬†to support our development efforts! But first, feel free to¬†join our  Public Discord  to get access to the latest FREE public versions of our games, and get a taste of what we're offering!¬† --- \n \n [ WEB COMIC ] We are currently publishing a monthly-ish webcomic featuring the characters from our games in adorable chibi form, as showcased below! This is a mini-series featuring their non-canon shenanigans, after we ask the wall-breaking question,  \"What if the characters from the games were fully aware that they're all characters in a game? ... And also, met up regularly at a bar or something to unwind?\" The webcomic is totally SFW, and only ever gets to an \"ecchi\" level in terms of adult content. This series is free and publicly viewable, although our patrons do get to read the latest comic strips in advance! --- [ ARTWORK ] Every month, our art team works on a lot of miscellaneous artwork, from character concepts to setting designs, that we often eventually work into our games! These art pieces are often planned out and completed before the certain levels of a game end up \"built\" around them. We really do work on a wide variety of things, such as planning out how certain types of monsters look, act, and feel...¬† ... to designing rather fun character concepts, like, say, a towering Viking wonderwoman who forcibly conscripts your ass to go on a kinky Odyssey-type adventure.¬† And of course, we also work on polished, high-quality CG sets that take place in a wide range of settings and situations, with scenes such as a young traveler stepping out onto dry land after a long voyage, and gazing out at an idyllic sunrise...¬† ... and then there's decidedly more mischievous scenes that should leave  very  little up to the imagination...! --- [ WHY BECOME A PATRON? ] Well, I'd like to think that if you enjoyed our work, you wouldn't mind contributing to our production costs!¬† You see, I'm a writer. That's all I am. I'm a poor artist, and a horrendous coder. But, writing alone isn't enough to create awesome adult games and comics. As such, I need to hire skilled artists, programmers, and other creative talents to \ndevote their time to work on the Dystopian Project. That is where you come in!  By becoming a patron, you allow me to pay for their services, and keep on working on games, comics, and artwork! If you are new to Patreon, please note that pledges are NOT a one-time donation. When you make a pledge and become a patron, you're basically committing to pay an amount of your \nchoosing every month. As a patron, you will get to see NSFW sneak peeks and concept artwork on our post feed, as well as gain exclusive access to ALL the games we produce! Every month, you'll also be able to vote on the direction of our production process and directly influence gameplay content. Finally, at the higher pledge tiers, you'll get all kinds of bonus goodies, such as art packs, cosplay babe collabs, and more! --- [ FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ] Q:  Can I 'try before I buy'? A: ¬†Yes, of course! To view our publicly-available content and demo versions, join our¬† public discord ! Q:  I pledged and became a patron - how do I join Discord? A:  You should receive a Discord invitation link to the email address you registered your Patreon account with! That invite will let you join our Discord channel. If you did not receive a Discord invite, please send a private message and I'll help you out ASAP!¬† Q:  I'm a patron! Where do I get my rewards? A: ¬†As soon as you pledged, you will get an immediate invite to our Discord, where the various download links are stored! Our monthly polls are held via Patreon posts, and the Art Pack rewards are sent out near the end of each month via the Patreon messaging system! Q:  I am interested in commissioning a custom storyline/questline! How do I do that? A: ¬†Our highest pledge tier will allow you to request a customized storyline, the accompanying CG set, and the accompanying sprite assets as well! You can do this once, for a sidequest, or pledge multiple times to have your ideas implemented into our games! Please send me a message before pledging to that tier, however, or we may have to refund you if we cannot accomodate your requests! There is also a hard limit on how many of these we can do! --- [ CREDITS ]  Here, I'd like to recognize all the people who have worked on the Dystopian Project and helped to make my dream a reality!¬† - Direction: Architect Additional Writing & Quest Design: „Å†„ÇÅ„Å†„ÇÅÂ≠ê (DDKgirl), Animela - CG Artwork: Pigutao, Nikki-Nikky Concept Artwork: Pigutao, Nikki-Nikky, VSEVLEZ Systems Artist: Nikki-Nikky Environment Artist: Arsministrator Character Artwork: Arsministrator,¬†Nikki-Nikky Additional Art Collabs/Contributions: ¬†JiangShi, armandox,¬†Ganassa, momdadno (MDN),¬† SacB0y,  Maxxiiee, Jingzy,¬† Keidiran, foxicube,¬†pollenoxide, HunterWithAPen - Lead Programmer: Berd - Lead Audio:   SLAS Additional Audio:   VoiceLikeCandy, IRecshun - Executive Producers: Blue Oak, TinyHat Studios, Flips, Raclevisto, SweetJP, Ranthe Testing & Debugging Contributions: Looners, hweirdo, Alariza -¬† And last but not least, special thanks to our esteemed top supporters...

I rap. I draw. I score films. You may know me from Living Legends, G&E, 3MG and Grand Tapestry.¬†\n \n ¬†Why I Love to Create Art¬† \n \nI was 17 when I recorded \"\n As They Pass \" in Grouch's basement. At that point, it didn't matter whether I was flat broke, malnourished with no official place to live. Why?  Because I was in heaven. I was making music! I was in love. \n \nI knew what I wanted to do from a young age. I knew in the 6th grade. I wanted to make music and art. I wanted to write and draw. I wanted nothing else. 21 years after \"\n As They Pass ,\" I'm still as in love as I was at 12. Although now, the desire to heal people has become a part of my art mission. I want to change the way you feel. I want to let you know you're not alone. I want to help you get clean, and I want to help you past the shackles of anxiety. And just as it was in 1996, I do  EVERYTHING  myself. ¬†The Challenge of Being Independent¬† \nI used to pay my bills with CD sales. It was my most reliable income for many years. But once the digital revolution took its course, you could imagine, artists like me, lost a reliable revenue stream. I hope streaming services will one day pay us royalties we deserve, but I can't afford to wait for that day.¬†I've never had a label, or even a team of people working for me. I've had a couple of amazing people walk with me through the years, but have never been able to KEEP people on because money has never been steady enough. (Shout out to my brother Eamon)\n \n \nBUT, somehow I've survived, and thrived, and am making some of my favorite music and art to date. How is that possible?? YOU ! My family. My people. I've used the digital world to get closer to you. To reach out directly to people who care about what I create. And every time I reach out, you guys respond. \n And although these bursts of support help me tremendously, this is a way to create some stability for me through your monthly support. \n \nWith the support you guys give me here, I can spend time creating, without worrying about how I'm going to make it through the month financially. I can get videos made, order new merch, give my albums a chance to be heard with proper promotional push. It also gives me another opportunity to offer supporters something unique and personal from me.\n \n \n ¬†How Your Support Benefits You as Patrons (Rewards)¬† \nAs a $5 a month supporter, you will get a new song each month. \n At the end of the year, every year, you'll have a 12 song album that no one else will.  Only my Crow Family support team. It might be an instrumental, it might be a song, might be a film score, I won't know till I make it! I created a Crow Fam podcast, where I've been telling stories, and breaking down the history behind all of my solo album releases, as well as answering questions from the family on the pod!¬† \n \nI will also be holding a live video chat for supporters only, once a month, where we can talk about anything we want, AND I will draw an 11x14 piece once a month, scan it, and send everyone a high res image that you can print out and frame if you wanted. \n Only my Patrons will get it.   \n \nNow of course, if any of you felt you could help me out with more than $5 a month, please feel free. That would be amazing! \n \nFor those who could afford $25 or up a month, you will get everything mentioned above, plus a spot on my guest list for any show, anytime, for as long as your a supporter. For those who can pledge $50 and up, you get all of the above, plus a phone call once a month with me, to talk about life for a bit, or whatever you feel!\n \n \nI've said this before, and I mean it, YOU are my lifeline! YOU guys allow me to continue chasing my dreams. \n This support will bring me stability, something I've never had as an indie-underground artist, and hopefully it will bring you joy in return. \n \nHope to see you join Crow Fam... Love you guys ! \n \n \nEligh\n \n \n ¬†FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)¬† When will I get charged? ¬†New patrons get charged as soon as you sign up and will get charged the first of the month moving forward. So if you sign up on the 15th, you'll get charged that day and you will get charged the 1st of every month as long as you are subscribed. This also means if you sign up at the end of the month like the 31th, you will get charged back to back. If that happens, just let me know and I will refund you a month. How do I get access to older art pieces and songs from previous months?  Only 3 month's worth of art pieces and songs will be available for $5 and $10 tiers at any given time. If you want to get access to the entire archive, you will need to be in a $15 and up tier. You only need to do this for one month, then you can easily move down to a $5 or $10 tier to continue getting new art and songs each month. You can also message me and I can share links to the archived content. When will the new song and print drop?  The 4th of the month. How can I listen to Patreon exclusive songs and podcasts outside of the Patreon app? There's a cool feature called an RSS Feed that posts all of my Patreon songs and podcast episodes to your podcast listening app. This makes it more convenient to listen to any Patreon audio files on your smartphone. When I put out a new song or episode on Patreon, it will automatically load into your favorite podcast listening app. This RSS Feed will only allow you to access the audio files for the tier that you're in as it's unique to your account. Check out this link on how to set it up for your phone: https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041347732#h_9f9ac9db-45f0-4a0d-9c37-9010442b2887   Why am I required to input a shipping address ?  To make it easier for us to ship you any physical rewards or merch items, we collect this information ahead of time. If you were not required to enter your shipping address when you first signed up,¬†go to \"My profile settings\" in the drop-down list by clicking the upper right-hand corner. There should be a section where you input your address for physical items. Can I cancel at any time? ¬†Yes, you can cancel for any reason at any time. You can also¬†adjust your pledge amount to a lower tier if you don't want to completely drop out. When do you host video chats?  Usually mid-month. I will make a post around a week before a tentative date as a heads up. \n How does the guestlist for shows work?  As long as you're an Owl member, you can get on the guestlist of any show I'm performing at. There might be an occasional show this won't work for, such as big festivals where I don't have a huge guest list, either way, I'd let you know! Just send an email to  [email¬†protected]  when the show you want to attend is coming up. When do¬† monthly phone calls take place? ¬†For my Phoenix members, monthly phone call reminders are sent out the first week of the month. You can select and schedule your 30-minute time slot on a first come first serve basis from the available days each month. When are Crowcasts released each month?  New podcasts will drop around the middle of each new month.", "amount_post": 1, "amount_subs": 405, "price_tiers": [{"title": "Egg", "monthly": "$1", "description": "Eggs are my starters!

He started this site as a hobby to learn some new technologies and to have a bit of fun but it has turned into so much more than that for him and my many fans around the world. Ryan loves building this site. He loves knowing he has helped hundreds of thousands of people optimize their Pokemon Go playing with this site he built mostly by himself.  CMO   Shelley Barker¬† Shelley Barker is married to Ryan Barker. She initially had no idea what he was talking about when he mentioned starting this website. But eventually, she figured it out and has been helping any way she can. With zero programming skills and a background in advertising, she has helped build and manage the research articles section of Pokebattler, create and update countless infographics, create and narrate YouTube videos and manage branding and other social channels. She also recently revamped the help menu so that is (hopefully) makes more sense.¬† Supporting Pokebattler.com¬† So why should you support us? We have some big plans for what we want to do with this site. The costs are creeping up each month as we start to generate more and more traffic. ¬†The projected costs for the features we want to add is even higher so the more support we have, the more we can give you. We'd¬†also love to eventually support some of the article writers and others who have helped out along the way.¬† Ads have been removed from the site and Patreon is our only source of revenue at this time.

All documents that have a  public version  are available. We are dedicated to helping those that want to bring more diversity to the art of gaming. We will do this by sponsoring attendance at diverse gaming conventions, promoting those that are making diverse games, indie projects and presenting on the topics of diversity in gaming at conventions. So  please support our work on Patreon,  even $1 per month will help. One of our goals is to have  more articles, to pay people for their contributions, and to do more tangible things for the community. We also want to help others get to conventions, share their work if funding is an issue. We would love your support to send aspiring game devs to conventions like GDC, IGDA events in their city, GeekGirlCon,FlameCon, GaymerX, HavenCon, VectorConf, East Coast Games Conference, and other places where gaming and diversity are part of the conversation. We want to do this by highlighting work by marginalized, underrepresented people in the industry, getting their voices heard and their work seen be it a game, articles, etc. But that takes resources and time. Our founder does this full time, others give what time they can to moderate our spaces, and dedicate our time to better diversifying the games space. So in the meantime, we humbly ask for your support to do the work we can and to bring change to the art form we love and want to make better! Thank you so much for whatever support you can give towards our work. Cheers, Tanya D. aka cypheroftyr @cypheroftyr // @INeedDivGms  [email¬†protected] Our purpose and mission: The Mission of I Need Diverse Games: I Need Diverse Games via all associated platforms and members; including but not limited to: twitter, Facebook, Google+,  and other mediums seeks to bring projects, works and research by marginalized folks to light. We also seek to discuss, analyze and critique identity and culture in video games through a multi-faceted lens rooted in intersectionality How we achieve our Mission and Goals: Participating in the Game Developers Conference Scholarship program which sends 25 people to GDC, one of the most important professional development conferences in the games industry. Each scholar gets an All Access Pass, a $2000 USD value given to us each year by the conference to assist those who would normally be unable to attend due to the cost. Publishing articles on diversity in games who would otherwise not have a voice on issues relevant to them in the works they see and others create. We pay contributors for their work. Work with other conferences and conventions to provide passes, free of charge to attendees that would normally not be able to attend events such as GaymerX, OrcaCon, HavenCon, AlterConf and others due to monetary issues Speak at conventions on issues of diversity as relevant to our mission and goals. Or assist others in going to conventions to attend such talks and panels. Participate in Diversity and Inclusion focused activities at conventions & conferences, and offer volunteer opportunities so community members can attend such events while assisting with our table. Purpose: Provide a safe online space for gamers of color and gamers of any other marginalized identities (including race, gender, sexual orientation, neurodiversity, disability, etc.) to discuss, promote, and educate for inclusion within the gaming industry and games themselves. Promote the work of creators in the gaming industry, including journalists, developers, artists that are marginalized and would otherwise go unheard. Encourage and defend diversity in all forms of gaming, and most importantly, make sure it is done right, by creating conversations that invite both critique and praise for the art of gaming. Promote posts on social media and online publications that use a sociological lens to talk about video, tabletop and other forms of games as well as gaming culture, posts that raise awareness of PoC activism and independent projects, and posts that discuss the future of games as a form of media. Maintain journalistic integrity, as well as accountability, in the discussion of the need for diverse gaming with the goals of education and growth in that community. We view diversity as a way to enrich the video game experience, not a quota to be filled, or a tool to avoid criticism. Diversity is essential not just to reflect the variety of our community, but also to push the limits of immersion, to present audiences with a perspective that they have never experienced before, and ultimately, to foster empathy for others.

After two years and a wedding, I sort of felt like I'd run out of things to say.¬† At this point I'd begun posting Plan With Me videos on my channel each month to share my Bullet Journal journey with you, a journey I had begun years prior.¬† I took a break from creating regular content and only posted my monthly Bullet Journal videos for almost a year.¬† And in that year my YouTube channel grew faster than it ever had before! I realized I had a deep passion for Bullet Journaling and sharing tips and inspiration in this wonderfully kind and supportive community with all of you, and decided to shift the focus of my channel to revolve around Bullet Journaling with just a dash of my other interests (including mental health, sustainable living, and veganism). And all of this brings us to today.¬† I am currently creating weekly videos on my YouTube channel and almost daily content on Instagram.¬† But I want to be able to provide even more value for you!

It allows people who love\na creator‚Äôs work to support it  directly  and  voluntarily,  at a level that seems reasonable to them.   \n\nIf you value a thing someone is creating, you might decide\nto pay a small amount each month, if only to help ensure the continued creation of that\nthing. You decide what's reasonable. \n\nThis is a much better system for everyone, because the value\nexchange happens directly between creator and fan, rather than getting filtered through a\nthird-party advertiser that neither of us wants involved.  \n\nFor the monthly cost of a coffee‚Äîor if you're so inclined, a deluxe burrito‚Äîyou will be supporting the work you\nlove, and freeing us all from The Man. Plus you‚Äôll get access to some extra things,\nand become part of a community of fellow fans.   Patreon Support = More Raptitude Your contribution helps free up my time so that I can focus\non creating more and better things for you. With more time I can make more elaborate\nposts, including those ones with hand-drawn graphics, which are intensely\ntime-consuming but so much fun. Once this thing gets going, the sky‚Äôs the limit\n‚Äì a book, a podcast, a world tour? If you appreciate Raptitude and its message, consider becoming a member of our community. Whatever you can offer is graciously welcomed, and I'll do\nwhatever I can to make it worth your while.

If you're reading this, chances are you know me as Chris from the¬† website  (and¬† Facebook community ) Autistic Not Weird: former primary school teacher turned autism speaker/blogger/author. What I do: Having left teaching and started Autistic Not Weird in April 2015, I have since¬† delivered speaking engagements  nationwide (including for the NHS, the National Autistic Society, mainstream/special school staff teams and students, the 2016-2020 Autism Shows, counselling teams and so on), and internationally for Autism Awareness Australia and India Autism Centre. My website, Autistic Not Weird, has received over 2,500,000 page hits and nearly 130,000 Facebook followers (at time of writing), while¬† the \"Underdogs\" series , endorsed by Steve Silberman and Michael Grant (and positively reviewed by  The Guardian !), is two books through its series so far, with a third in its pre-order stage. Before Patreon, this was all achieved during my spare time- in spite of me being occupied by three jobs, a masters degree, captaincy of my local Boys' Brigade, and various offline commitments to people I love. Now, thanks to my Patreon supporters, I have been able to quit a job and devote whole working days per week to writing for Autistic Not Weird! What I plan to do: I now intend for my autism advocacy to become a viable full-time career, which is absolutely possible with the right support. Autistic Not Weird is now literally a part-time job, and the more secure my income is, the more safely I can commit to spending my days doing the following: Working on Autistic Not Weird as both an educational site and a supportive community; Providing advice and consultancy to those who request help from me; Producing more helpful content for¬† Autistic Not Weird's YouTube channel ; Publishing more books to promote understanding of autism; Providing more seminars and training sessions, nationally and internationally. It's also worth mentioning that I have monthly \"supervision\" sessions with a therapist for my work with Autistic Not Weird, as it often involves very sensitive work with vulnerable people. These sessions are funded entirely by my Patreon followers, who I am eternally grateful to for enabling me to access the support I need. How Patreon works: Patreon is typically used as a way for an artist/musician's fanbase to gain support from their supporters. This allows them to worry less about where their next meal is coming from, and focus more on actually doing the job they love. Pledges are made using the right-hand column, in exchange for a variety of rewards and perks! And finally... To those who have read to the end, thank you very much- and thank you too for the support who have provided to the Autistic Not Weird community: whether you are a frequent poster or have simply read an article or two. Please consider supporting this Patreon venture: with enough support, I will be able to spend the rest of my days writing, speaking and publishing to support the worldwide autism community. Thanks again, Chris Bonnello http://autisticnotweird.com https://www.facebook.com/autisticnotweird https://www.youtube.com/AutisticNotWeird https://chrisbonnello.com/ - One final important note: A number of people have asked me if there's a one-off donation option.

I've worked as\na fantasy fiction editor in New York City, directed a mythic arts\norganization in Boston, co-founded an arts retreat in the Arizona\ndesert, and now live in a small English village on Dartmoor, surrounded by artists and sheep. I work from \n The   Bumblehill Studio , my faithful hound usually curled up beside me; and I write a daily blog about myth, art, and nature, called \n Myth & Moor . \n \nI've won nine World Fantasy Awards, the Mythopoeic Award, the Bram\nStoker Award, and the SFWA Solstice Award for \"outstanding\ncontributions to the speculative fiction field as a writer, editor,\nartist, educator, and mentor.\" I've been short-listed twice for the Shirley Jackson Award, and once for the Tiptree.\n \n \n \n \nThe work I'm best known for:\n \n \nIn the field of fantasy literature, most people know me best as an editor and anthologist. In the 1980s, I was the senior editor for fantasy at Ace Books, created a young adult\nfantasy line for Ace/Tempo Books, and then worked as a consulting fantasy editor\nfor Tor Books for two decades thereafter. Over the years I've published\nthe first novels and stories of many writers who have gone on to be major\nfigures in the field; and helped to nuture the modern\nrenaissance of \n fairy tale literature  for adult readers. I've also\nchampioned the short story form by publishing over \n 30 anthologies ,\nincluding 16 volumes of \n The Year's Best Fantasy & Horror  series\n(with Ellen Datlow). \n \n \nFrom 1987 to 2008, I ran The\nEndicott Studio for Mythic Art, which supported writers, artists, and\nscholars working with myth, folklore and fairy tales. Projects\nincluded \n The Armless Maiden  anthology, the award-winning  Journal of Mythic Arts  (published from 1997 to 2008), and The Endicott West Arts Retreat.\nRun as a nonprofit, all Endicott proceeds supported charities for\nabused, homeless, and \"at risk\" children. In 2008 I launched  Myth & Moor  (short-listed for the World Fantasy Award), and in the years since I've continued to work with fantasy and myth in a range of ways, including editing, lecturing, and as a member of the  Modern Faeries  research project (sponsored by Oxford and Sheffield Universities). \n \n \n \n The\nwork I love best:\n   \n \nI feel honored and privileged to have edited and mentored so many fine writers over the years -- but the work I love best is writing myself, and creating art based on my own stories. \n \n \nI've published one adult novel, \n The Wood Wife  (winner of the\nMythopoeic Award), along with five small books for children, a handful of\nnovellas and stories, and many, many articles and essays\non myth, folklore, fairy tales, fantasy literature and other magical\nart forms. I've also created folkloric paintings, drawings, and collages, which have been published, printed, and exhibited in museums\nand galleries in US and Europe.\n \n \nWriting and art take time, however, and editing is what pays the bills -- thus my writing output is woefully slow, and I'm determined to make that change. I want to cut severely back on editing now in order to focus on writing and painting...and bring all the stories inside of me out onto the page and into the world. \n \n \nWhy Patreon?\n \n \nI entered the publishing field in a very different era -- before the internet, ebooks, Amazon, and other factors changed the industry in myriad ways. Back then, it was still possible for a  midlist   writer to make a modest living from her work -- while today, most of us need to find at least part of our income from another source. I like the idea of Patreon because it enables readers to support the writers they want to read and illustrators whose work they want to see more of, facilitating the creation of books and other projects that would otherwise not exist.  \n \nI believe deeply in the power of community -- so community funding that allows creators to create is a powerful and beautiful thing.¬† ¬† \n \n \n \n \n Why now?  \n \nFirst of all I'm not getting any younger, so time to devote to my own writing and painting is feeling increasingly urgent. I have books-in-progress I want to\ncomplete, ideas for others filling up my notebooks, half-finished\npaintings on my work table, and every that day I neglect them feels like a betrayal of the tales I have to tell. \n \n \nSecond, the energy I use to do my work is limited by\nhealth issues that I've had since I was young. I have good days and I\nhave bad days. I'm a disciplined worker, and I labor very hard on the\ngood days to make up for the bad -- but this too has impacted my\ncreative output. When I'm working hard as an editor, there's little\nenergy for anything else.\n \n \nMy\nfriends have urged me to try Patreon, to see if\nit this model of community-funded art will work for me -- allowing me\nto  turn more of my time over to writing and painting.\n \n \n \n \n \n Work in progress: \n \n* \n The Moon Wife : a novel for adult readers (loosely connected to  The Wood Wife )\n about artists from Pre-Raphaelite times to the present, steeped in \nfairies and fairy tales. I'm in the second draft stage on this -- but it\n still needs a lot of work due to being a long and complex narrative. * A lightly illustrated novel for Middle Grade readers (8-to-12-year-olds) set in a magical version of rural Devon, involving my \"bunny girl\" and animal spirit characters. I'm close to completion of the first draft of the book, which doesn't yet have a title. The next step will be a tighter second draft, along with design and illustration roughs.  \n \n* \n A Story of Stories : a collection of my essays on folklore, fairy tales, and fantasy. The essays have all been written, but I'm editing them and writing interstitial material which weaves them all together. \n \n* \"Rat and Blade\" and other novellas for the \n Bordertown  series (urban fantasy for teen readers), co-authored with  Ellen Kushner .  \n \n \n \n \n What patron funding is used for: \n \n* \n Work time: \n Although my small family lives very modestly in a tiny house at the edge of the moor, England is an expensive country to live in -- plus I have extra costs of supplementary health-care, and high vet bills for our dog Tilly (who has an auto-immune disease kept in check by monthly medication that costs the moon). Patreon funding helps to cover my share of household costs, and medical costs, so that I can stop editing and start writing. \n \n*  Office assistance:  Working alone, my days are often swallowed up by the admin work involved with publishing -- leaving me with little time for the creative work itself. Since autumn 2019, however, Patreon funds have allowed me to hire an editorial assistant, Lunar Hine, to work with me several hours a week. This has been an  enormous  blessing. (More information  here .) *  Specific writing and art projects :  Once the above expenses are securely covered, I have a number of specific book projects I'd like to get cracking on.  Please see the Stretch Goals panel (on the left) for more information. On the art side of my work, additional funding would allow me make new cards & prints, publish an annual calendar, and update my studio tools -- enabling me to get more artwork out into the world, \nin printed and original forms.  \n \n \n \nMy promise to you:\n \n \nIf\nyou choose to become a patron of the Bumblehill Studio, I promise you I will put my\nheart and soul into making works of fiction and art inspired by folklore, fairy tales, the natural world, and my personal history. \n \n \n\"Everything is held together with stories,\" says the great American writer \n Barry Lopez . \"That is all that is holding us together, stories and compassion.\" \n \n \nI couldn't agree more.\n \n \n \n", "amount_post": 24, "amount_subs": 357, "price_tiers": [{"title": "Bumbles", "monthly": "$1", "description": "\n For your kind patronage you'll receive:¬† \n Patron-only posts about creative work and daily life here at Bumblehill, including more personal discussions and photos than those I post publicly on the  Myth & Moor  blog. \n Patron-only videos: including seasonal Question & Answer sessions, occasional readings from works-in-progress, and (starting Jan. 2020) video conversations with other myth-oriented writers, artists, and storytellers here on Dartmoor. \n My humble thanks for your support of my work. \n"}, {"title": "Bumblers", "monthly": "$3", "description": "The same as above, since we all have different income levels and this basic level of patronage is on a sliding scale.

However you've found me, thanks for stopping by and I hope you enjoy my work.  Speaking of which... I'm on Patreon because making a living writing about, researching or illustrating fossil animals - even really cool ones - is not always easy. It amounts to being a specialist freelancer, which means paying projects can be rare, workloads are unpredictable, and vast spans of time can exist between being paid (e.g. book royalties are only paid annually).¬†Patreon is one solution to this. As a crowd-funding scheme for online creatives, it gives you a method to support your favourite authors and artists with micropayments each month. In return for your money, you get access to exclusive content and rewards. The more you pledge, the more you receive in rewards: prints, books and so on. But for starters, a $1 per month donation entitles you to: In-progress and exclusive artwork related to upcoming books, blog posts and papers 'Behind the scenes' insights into creative projects Insights into new research Excerpts from upcoming books Competitions Your pledges support the production of my art and writing, enabling me to tackle more detailed and involved projects, produce content at a higher rate, and improve the quality of what I can produce. Hopefully, this will make what I'm doing more sustainable for me, and more interesting for you: to that end,  any  donation you can offer, however small, is hugely appreciated.

This training method and the films I have made in the process of my research have been all based on a few intriguing questions. What if horses were given a choice and a voice? Would they let us ride them?  Without force or tools to control and without bribes to lure them? What started as simple questions, birthed the first movie, Taming Wild and an online course for students interested in learning Freedom Based Training¬Æ. I draw on a long and diverse history with horses as I continue to research, develop and film documentaries. All of this has gathered together amazing people from around the globe who also seek their own answers in what it takes to work more collaboratively with horses. As tends to happen, questions birth more questions, and so I continue on this Taming Wild journey with a second film in post production and a third movie about to start filming, a book soon to be out, and an ever-growing community of brilliant minds exploring ideas with me. What does it take to truly work together in freedom? Please join the community and help us ask the questions, which take us to the answers that make the world a better place for equines and humans together everywhere.

Patreon funds will be invested in what you see on the screen. I would like to upgrade my equipment for a start, and get some technical help. I would also like to invest in getting subtitles added. I don‚Äôt think viewers should be excluded who don‚Äôt speak English. And I would of course LOVE to make a living out of just making these videos. Your donation would help to keep Great Art explained going, and keep it free for everyone.  I am passionate about art and I¬†believe that everyone should know more about it.  Art IS complicated, but I hope to be able to help you sift through all the mass of information and unnecessary art jargon,¬†and come out after fifteen minutes with some¬†understanding of what makes a masterpiece.¬† Art has liberated me, made me question the world, moved me, made me laugh  and  cry, and expanded my soul. Art can be thrilling if you allow it to be. And I want to help others get as much from it as I do.¬† Art, particularly contemporary art, often feels intimidating, and people often look on art history as something complicated, but it is simple: Art is a mirror of our society. It reflects the culture of the time, so by studying art, it can help you understand the culture and its time. It is how people across the ages have communicated non-verbally, and its what makes us human. How many times have I heard \"The Mona Lisa is a clich√©\" or about Picasso, \"My five year old can do that\". But it is  how  you look at the work, place it in its context and have some understanding of the history.¬† I don't want you to love every artwork I make a film about, but I do want you to think about it. What is art if it does not challenge you? It's decoration.¬† Art history is full of so many amazing stories of creation: Monet's Water Lilies and WWI, The assault of Artemisia Gentileschi that inspired her Judith, The peculiar block of marble that shaped Michelangelo's David. Stories that in and of themselves, are inspirational.¬† I don't expect people to know  everything  about the Spanish civil war, but I hope my video conveys how important it was for Picasso in the creation of Guernica.¬† Then I want to show you a little bit about technique.¬†How did artists make these materials work for them and in what ways. And why? I am not trying to re-invent the wheel, I am however trying to declutter the complicated codes and linguistic traps that are designed to keep us in the dark.¬† Something about me. I was lucky enough to be born in a city (London), where museums have free admission. So from a young age I would jump on a bus, and head to art galleries alone (helicopter parenting didn't exist yet). In school holidays,¬†I would spend hours in the Tate, or the national gallery or the British¬†Museum. Still to this day, I love visiting museums alone, with no¬†distractions, to let the art¬†sink into my body and soul.¬† Classical art was what interested me, but I clearly remember seeing the Rothko room at the Tate for the first time at thirteen. Obviously I didn't understand it, and it confused me, disturbed me, and shocked me. A few weeks later, I was back again, curious as to why I was still thinking about them, and this time there was a guided tour going on in the Rothko room. I listened to the woman, whose passion for Rothko was almost palpable. The thing was, she wasn't spouting complicated theory, she was telling a story. That is what sparked an interest. I didn't fall in love with the paintings, I fell in love with the story. ¬† It¬†made me want to learn more about New York, about where he came from, and why he made the choices he did. It gave me a springboard to learn about the art.¬† I still feel the same way about Michelangelo, and Raphael, and Goya, and Agnes Martin. I want to know more. I want to be informed about¬†why their work has meaning to them. I finally studied Fine Art (at Central St. Martin's) in my thirties. I¬†studied to be an artist, but I ended up more and more, curating. I eventually co-owned a gallery (PayneShurvell) in London, which we eventually closed, as London rental prices are exorbitant.¬† I still curate and write about art for various websites.¬† My main job (that pays the bills) is as a European history guide for a travel company. Obviously the pandemic finished that off.¬† And that's when I started making these videos. Which I am still learning to make. I had no idea I needed a mic when I started - or even what a pop filter was!  Videos for me work, because art is a visual medium. I know that when I watch art history videos I get frustrated when it is just a talking head, or just the same picture throughout. I need more visuals, I am a visual person. Great Art Explained is an art channel, so I spend hours looking for the perfect visual. That is the artist side of me.  I cannot believe how many subscribers I have, and how many views my videos get. It blows my mind, that something I love to do, is watched by so many. I am still learning and hope you can join me on that journey.¬† I'd love your support so I can invest in my channel, but don't worry if you can't, just keep watching and learning.

We are¬† GamingOnLinux.com , what we commonly refer to a \"GOL\"! It's a completely independent gaming website, dedicated to Linux and Steam Deck / SteamOS gaming. We find the news and chase down developers, so you don't have to!¬†We write new articles  almost  every day for you to keep up with everything around Linux / SteamOS gaming. In the past, you might have picked up a monthly gaming magazine, by pledging to us you could consider it like that, except you're also getting everything else we do as well.  Liam from GamingOnLinux (the owner) has written about Linux news for many years. Liam was the original gaming writer for the old  Linux Voice  magazine (R.I.P). You can see a  horrible  picture in many of their early issues. Here's more of what we do: We also track tons of  crowdfunded games , so you don't have to search around. We track plenty of  statistics about Steam . We run a  community forum . There's  even a Wiki ! Articles not your thing? We are also on¬† Twitch  and¬† YouTube ! On top of that, we also run the  Linuxers Reddit ,\n a subreddit designed to be a friendly and inviting place for old and \nnew Linux users alike. Don't like Reddit? Try out Lemmy, it's an open \nsource alternative and we also moderate  the linux_gaming Lemmy community . Want to know how much we've done on the site, or what anyone else has done on it? You can hit¬† this link . You will see there the amount of effort we put into it every month! The code that runs GOL is  open source  under the MIT license ( gitlab ).¬†We chose that license so that anyone can tinker with it re-use it and generally do whatever they like without any licensing hassles.  It's really only meant for GOL though, but hey if an issue bugs you, why not help out ;) \n Payments \nYou can pledge any amount you want from $1 to $\n whatever . It's your choice, you don't even need to pick a reward. We appreciate it no matter what! \n \nPayments are taken once a month around the 1st of each month. \n We've enabled up-front payments, so you're charged for the first time\n when you initially subscribe and then again on the 1st of each month.  If you up your pledge, it will also be taken instantly! How to get supporter status to show up on the website When you've paid each month, simply  go to this page and login with Patreon . It will refresh your account and give you supporter status. \n \n What to expect from this Patreon \nWhile most of the work goes into writing articles and working on the websites code, we will be throwing out information early to certain Patreon supporters on what we're working on. You will also have a direct say in what we do next. We will be involving you in the process of our work, as much as possible. We will also give you sneak peeks at things before they are ready to go on the website.\n You also get the few special extras as noted on the tiers, like a promise of no adverts for you (ever!) if you are at least at the \"Supporter\" ($4) level. You can also find the  special Supporter Forum here . \n \nNone of this is possible without your support!

The library provides a space for reading, writing, rest, community building, and connection.  Through this work, I illustrate the transformative power of books and community, while lifting up the brilliance, creativity, and diversity within Black womanhood.¬† In 2022 we launch our Reading Room, a storefront that will contain our book collection and serve as a literary hub and creative co-working space for the community.¬† Patreon funds are used to cover the labor, expenses, and supplies needed to run The Free Black Women's Library.

I will also show you how to choose your colours, create an accurate outline, and give you some projects I recommend that you start with! \n \nThe tutorials in this section will help you understand the process and decision-making of drawing and painting so you can follow along with any of my larger projects, or choose a reference to draw from on your own! \n \n ¬†Relax and Enjoy some REPS sessions!¬† ¬† (You will find these at the bottom of the Patreon Tutorial Library) \n R = Relax Take some time to relax, enjoy drawing, listen to some music, a podcast, the birds outside, your favourite audiobook... or just enjoy the silence! You can follow along with me, use the video for inspiration, or use the \"prompt\" to find your own reference photo to draw! The goal is to get comfy and have some fun sketching! \n E = Experiment Use this time to experiment with new mediums, new subjects, new papers, or new techniques! \nDon't get too caught up in a \"perfect\" end result - Play around and try new things! \n P = Practice \nThis is a fantastic time to practice any of your weak points! Whether that's freehanding, drawing certain subjects, colour mixing, value studies, or different textures - this is a safe space to give yourself permission to \"have a go\" without feeling the need to create a \"masterpiece\"! \n S = Sketch Remember these are supposed to be quicker \"sketches\" rather than completed drawings! Try setting a time limit and see what you can get done in that time frame! \n...Or take as long as you want - it's up to you - this is supposed to be relaxing and fun :) \n \nR.E.P.S sessions are *BONUS* silent videos! There is a full list of supplies in the description, along with the reference photos I have used... However, there is no voiceover instruction. These videos are in real-time, so you can still see every step of the sketching process! They are also simple enough for you to follow along (without instruction) if you wish! \n \n ¬†Struggling to find the supplies I have listed in my tutorials? Trust me, I know your pain!¬† \nI have Amazon links to all of the supplies I am using for those living in the US/UK/AU But if you are living somewhere without an Amazon site (or you can't get the supplies you need from Amazon) it can be quite hard to find certain supplies... Pastelmat for example! Jackson's is a UK-based art supply store, that actually ships worldwide (some of their products are cheaper than what I can get in Australia, so the shipping is worth it!) I have a full list of all the supplies I use, with direct links to each product from Jackson's here https://www.kirstyrebeccafineart.com/supplylists AND if you purchase ANYTHING from Jackson's after clicking any of my links, you'll receive 10% off your entire first order! \n \n \n ¬†How do the payments work?¬† ¬† Once you've chosen your tier level and joined Patreon, you will have immediate access to all of the benefits for your tier level! \n \nAs a new patron, your payment will be processed on the day you become a patron, then on that SAME DATE each month going forward* *This is a NEW feature as of Sept 2022 - Previously, you would have been charged on the date you join, then on the 1st of each month going forward (even if you joined on the 30th, you would have been charged again on the 1st) \n ¬†What if you change your mind?¬† ¬† That is totally okay! \n \nOn a monthly membership, you can easily upgrade, downgrade or cancel your pledge or cancel at any time via your Patreon Account settings.¬†\n \n ¬†Sharing/selling your artwork created from the tutorials¬† Generally, most artists who create online tutorials do not allow you to sell your work, enter any competitions, or claim it as your own in any way. You are allowed to use the tutorials as practice ‚Äì and that‚Äôs all. \n \nThe main reasons why people have these ‚Äúrules‚Äù is because they have either used their own reference photos for their tutorials (or have paid for the reference so they have the right to use the photo ‚Äì but their students don‚Äôt) and also because people generally don‚Äôt like it when other people copy their work and claim it as their own \n \nHowever, I am not as fussed as some other people about some of these ‚Äúrules‚Äù \n \nSo, to answer some of your questions; \n \n Can I share the artwork I created by following one of your tutorials online? (to Facebook/Instagram/your own website etc) \n\t \n\t I purposely use free royalty-free reference photos, so you won‚Äôt have any legal copyright issues if you upload your work online‚Ä¶ BUT please don‚Äôt claim it as your own work. I have seen quite a lot of posts recently on social media that are almost an exact replica of my artwork (which is great ‚Äì I love seeing the work you create from the tutorials) but the artist is basically claiming that they came up with the idea, techniques, colour choices, backgrounds etc. \n\t\t The courteous, fair, respectful, and honest thing to do is to credit the teacher when you post your artwork online if you follow a tutorial. For example, you can simply add ‚Äútutorial by Kirsty Rebecca Fine Art‚Äù at the bottom of your post \n\t\t\t Can I enter the artwork I created by following one of your tutorials in a competition or show (online or in-person)? \n\t\t\t\t\tNo. This is actually because competitions require you to enter ‚Äúoriginal artwork‚Äù. So understandably, if you copy one of my tutorials, you (along with many others) would have created copies of the same piece of artwork, that I originally created ‚Äì therefore you would be breaking competition ‚Äúrules‚Äù \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Can I sell the artwork I created by following one of your tutorials? \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI don‚Äôt have any issues with you selling your work created from the tutorials ‚Äì just remember to credit the teacher (myself) by adding ‚Äútutorial by Kirsty Rebecca Fine Art‚Äù to your website listing/social media post etc when you advertise it for sale \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHopefully, this makes things a little clearer! ¬†How can you contact me?¬† If you have any questions about the tiers, payments or Patreon in general, you are welcome to email me at  [email¬†protected] \n \n ---- \n \nThank you for considering supporting me on Patreon!¬†\n \n", "amount_post": 118, "amount_subs": null, "price_tiers": [{"title": "Silver (Basic)", "monthly": "$5.50", "description": "BEFORE YOU JOIN PATREON Have you considered joining the¬† KR Fine Art Academy instead?

Each tutorial is in real-time with a clear voice-over explaining what I'm doing every step of the way! I'll also provide tips and techniques to help you learn and improve on your artistic journey! Every tutorial is between 1 and 7 hours (or more), depending on the medium and subject My tutorials don't skip any stages or cut out important parts of the process, and I will share all of my \"secrets\" to help you improve! You will have access to useful resources such as; - Supply list (so you have everything you need to get started!) - Original reference photo - Line art (to help you start with an accurate outline) - Colour swatch sample (to help you see, and choose colours) ‚óá  NEW TUTORIALS every month! ‚óá Every month I upload at least one NEW tutorial to the library, usually more! ‚óá  INSTANT ACCESS to the beginner‚Äôs section! ‚óá This section will give you the knowledge you need to get started! You will learn how to choose your own reference photos and how to edit your references to help with the drawing process. I will also show you how to choose your colours, create an accurate outline, and give you some projects I recommend that you start with! Additional tutorials will be added to this section regularly to help you understand the process and decision-making of drawing and painting so you can follow along with any of my larger projects, or choose a reference to draw from on your own! ‚óá  Relax and enjoy the REPS sessions! ‚óá R = Relax Take some time to relax, enjoy drawing, listen to some music, a podcast, the birds outside, your favourite audiobook... or just enjoy the silence! You can follow along with me, use the video for inspiration, or use the \"prompt\" to find your own reference photo to draw! The goal is to get comfy and have some fun sketching! E = Experiment Use this time to experiment with new mediums, new subjects, new papers, or new techniques! Don't get too caught up in a \"perfect\" end result - Play around and trial new things! P = Practice This is a fantastic time to practice any of your weak points! Whether that's freehanding, drawing certain subjects, colour mixing, value studies, different textures - this is a safe space to give yourself permission to \"have a go\" without feeling the need to create a \"masterpiece\"! S = Sketch Remember these are supposed to be quicker \"sketches\" rather than completed drawings! Try setting a time limit and see what you can get done in that time frame! ...Or take as long as you want - it's up to you - this is supposed to be relaxing and fun :) R.E.P.S sessions are  BONUS  silent videos! There is a full list of supplies in the description, along with the reference photos I have used... However, there is no voiceover instruction.

It is hosted on a \ndedicated server using  Masto.Host . Why Patreon? Mastodon.ART relies\n on the support of its users to pay for its operating costs. Running a \ncommunity like .ART isn't free‚Äì .ART will never run ads, sponsored \nposts, sell its users data, or track them‚Äì and is committed to providing\n a safe and supportive home on the web for artists of all kinds. \nHowever, there are still hosting and maintenance costs, and your support\n will ensure that this community remains free and open for many years to\n come. How will this money be used? Any funds\n collected from Patreon will go back into paying for and supporting the \nMastodon.ART community, primarily by paying its server/operating costs \nand the cost of the Mastodon.ART domain, but also through commissions \nand other forms of support for its users. Who am I? I am  @WelshPixie  / Delyth Angharad, a Welsh artist living in South Africa. I am  the current admin \n of Mastodon.ART, taking over from the previous curator  Rheall  in Feb/2021. I run .ART with the help of a fantastic team of dedicated \nmoderators. I started using Mastodon in around November 2016, and after a brief start on .social, made the permanent switch to .ART where I settled right in. Being part of such a creative community has been wonderful, and I am honored and humbled to be taking over ownership of the instance. What is Mastodon? Mastodon \n is a FOSS decentralized micro-blogging social media platform (similar \nto Twitter, but with many changes/updates/upgrades) which uses the \nActivityPub protocol to allow its users to connect with other services \nalso using ActivityPub. Its strength lies in  decentralization : \nallowing users to form their own servers (known as \"instances\") from \nwhich to host their own community on the platform, leading to a service \nmade up of thousands of instances all connected to each other. Each \ninstance has its own rules, giving people the power to manage and \nmaintain their own social communities which are able to communicate with\n each other and  the wider 'Fediverse' of services using the ActivityPub protocol ,\n such as Pleroma, PeerTube, Plume, Pixelfed, FunkWhale, Friendica, Write\n Freely, and more. Decentralization resists a large, centralized, often \ncapitalist authority controlling how people use and implement the \nservice and their data, and instead gives freedom and power to its users\n to control their content, data, and community. With content warnings, \nimage descriptions, a robust suite of moderation tools, and more, \nMastodon focuses on accessibility, privacy, and safety to empower its \nusers.

Sometimes this can take  LONGER  if issues occur in manufacturing, as we push to getting pins as good as they can be. Please keep this in mind; we will always fulfill our pin promises, regardless of the time involved,  but there is patience involved .  We always will have some in-hands (though not necessarily standards) in the shop for patrons if you prefer to buy when they're ready. For being patient / helping with production, you get a steep discount for participating in the club (30%+).¬† Updates are always in Discord - please check there for routine progress! ¬† Regardless, thank you for helping us make these visions come to life!

I want to tell you a bit about me and why I've set up this page.¬† My pastel journey began in 2011.¬† Burned out in naturopathic medical school and ready for a change of scenery, I left Seattle and moved to the town of Sebastopol in the San Fransisco Bay area.¬† Throughout my life art was a constant companion, whether I was actively drawing and painting, or just thinking about art, and all the amazing artwork  I would create \"when I finally had enough time.\" ¬†¬† I had decided in 2011, at age 27, that art was to become a priority in my life and not just a fantasy, or a dream I would eventually pursue.¬† That year I traveled throughout the west and southwest attending workshops with some of my favorite pastel artists.¬†  Pastel painting became an obsession , and I'd spend 10-12 hours per day thinking about painting, watching videos, reading books, and ultimately attempting my hand at painting.¬† Many of those first pieces, probably the first 75-100, were utter failures.¬† They were cringe-worthy, but I had caught the painting bug, and  the subtle improvements I saw in my work were motivation to keep with it. ¬† I heard the words of more experienced artists emphasizing that  time at the easel was the way to become a better artist. ¬† After that year of total immersion, I finished my degree and picked painting back up in 2014.¬† Though life has become very full over the last several years (wife and kids, dog, house, medical career...the dream) I have always made painting a priority.¬†  \n\t\tWith this commitment, I have had the good fortune to win several international awards including the Award of Excellence \n(2nd place overall) in the 2018 Pastel 100, 3rd place overall in the \n2017 Annual Plein Air Salon, and 1st place in the 2017 UART Pastel Paper\n Online Exhibition, and awards in the Pastel Society of America 2017 and 2018 annual exhibitions.¬† I've also been fortunate to be featured in articles in a number of \npublications, including Southwest Art, Plein Air Magazine, American Art \nCollector, and the Pastel Journal.¬† And recent exhibits in 2019 include a group museum show at the Brinton Museum in Wyoming and a two person show at Kathryn Turner Fine Art in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. ¬† \n\t One thing I always wished I had when learning to paint in pastels was a  mentor, an instructor, somebody I could turn to when I felt stuck or needed support.¬† THAT is why I am starting this Patreon page.¬†  In-person workshops are not always feasible, often fill up fast, and can be¬† expensive when you add up travel, hotel, food, and workshop fees.¬† Further, my focus is shifting from teaching in-person workshops to this virtual teaching format.¬† It's no longer sustainable for me to teach 10-12 workshops per year, help raise two young kids, and continue my medical practice.¬† So something had to give!¬† And quite honestly, I get frustrated with the weekend workshop format.¬† I get to spend 2-3 days with an artist, really get to know them, witness their artistic breakthroughs, and potentially never get to work with them again. ¬†  What I am offering through my page: My number one goal as a painting instructor has always been and will continue to be  helping you achieve your painting goals , whatever they may be.¬† Whether your goal is to be an internationally known pastelist, or an artist who paints for the sheer pleasure of producing something with your hands,  I want you to feel as fulfilled by your art as I have been over these past 9 years.¬†  The graduated tiers I am offering run the gamut from video demonstrations to personal one-on-one mentoring.¬† ", "amount_post": 200, "amount_subs": 309, "price_tiers": [{"title": "Rembrandt", "monthly": "$9", "description": "Includes: Patron-only posts and messages Exclusive bi-monthly painting demonstration with full description of painting process   Weekly art tip Monthly group Zoom Q&A call with me!¬† Weekly Patreon artist spotlight on my Instagram and Facebook accounts. ¬†¬†  "}, {"title": "Sennelier", "monthly": "$15", "description": "Includes: Patron-only posts and messages Exclusive weekly painting demonstrations with full description of painting process Monthly group Q&A Zoom call with me!¬† Weekly art tip Weekly art challenge Private Facebook community Weekly Patreon artist spotlight on my Instagram and Facebook accounts. ¬†"}, {"title": "Ludwig", "monthly": "$30", "description": "Includes: Everything from Sennelier tier, plus: Monthly email painting critique"}], "tags": "", "socialmedias": ["https://www.instagram.com/jacobaguiarpastelpainter"]},

Hell-o Sinners! Thank you for taking the time to look at my Patreon page. I‚Äôm Eiynah, a Toronto based Ex-Muslim atheist (not the right-wing kind!)‚Ä¶. of Pakistani Background who grew up in Saudi Arabia (complicated backstory, I know).¬† What Do I do? I do variety of stuff, (If you‚Äôre on this page you may have heard of my show called¬† Polite Conversations ) mostly Podcasting  and illustration, but on occasion I blog, write articles and make children‚Äôs books too! My book¬† 'My Chacha (uncle) is Gay'  has been used in libraries and schools across the Toronto area.¬† I also enjoy talking about atheist-y stuff, my atheism is informed by my progressive values, unlike much of the current online atheist movement unfortunately.  My work has been featured on Buzzfeed, VICE magazine, ELLE magazine, Huffington Post and many more publications. I promise, I'm not *that* bad at what I do.  My Journey I started off as a blogger writing specifically about the topic of Pakistani sexuality (that‚Äôs where the name ‚ÄôNice Mangos‚Äô comes from) but now my work has expanded to include much more.  I became interested in discussing atheism & secularism and sort of fell into the New Atheist scene for a while (I know I know! Embarrassing :/ - but I guess leaving a harsh theocracy can make you vulnerable to that for a while). For what it‚Äôs worth, I‚Äôve left all that behind and am quite a vocal critic of the issues in the online atheist scene now, which doesn‚Äôt win me any friends in high places >___< Being a left leaning ex-muslim in this increasingly far right, anti-muslim climate is pretty rough. I feel that the ex muslim movement has shifted from having the noble goal of simply de-stigmatizing apostasy, to feeding the anti-islam/anti-muslim rightwing outrage machine... Where many prominent figures within the movement will ally with anyone giving them a platform to criticize Islam, be it Breitbart or Rebel Media. This is not something I would like to be a part of, so if you follow the online atheist scene, you'll notice I've distanced myself from that whole thing.    My Concerns and Areas of Focus As someone who grew up in Saudi Arabia, it's awful to see the western, more ‚Äòpolished' apologetics of extreme conservatism in the form of pseudo intellectuals like the 'Intellectual Dark Web'. I see familiar themes coming from that murky corner of the internet, themes I thought I left behind with the extreme Salafist mullahs in Saudi. Things like 'Can men and women really work together?', 'Are women simply not suitable for certain high paying jobs?', ‚ÄòA woman's natural role is to have babies‚Äô, ‚ÄòMeToo/feminism has gone too far‚Äô, etc. --This is the kind of thing I find alarming these days, and focus on tackling that in my work. Ironically, I've seen too many fellow ex muslims claim they're rejecting religion for containing bigoted views, only to find the same thing and embrace it in the form of western conservative public figures.  My goal for my podcast is to have interesting long-form conversations on a variety of topics, sometimes with people of opposing views, but that does not mean 'softballing' or even constantly manufacturing combative conversations for clicks.  How you Help If you enjoy my work, you can help support it through Patreon. Your support helps me allocate more time and resources into researching and producing a better quality podcast, more illustrations and longer term projects like children‚Äôs books. You can also help support the work by sharing it with friends and family you think might find it interesting, and by vocally supporting and sharing it on social media. :)  I'm a freelance graphic designer by day, so I have no 9-5 day job to fall back on, freelancing means a constant hustle to make a steady income. - your support makes a huge difference in my ability to continue podcasting! I am truly grateful to have people who support the creative work I do.  What you get If you sign up today, there are perks in it for you!

It Patreon provides me with consistent income, allowing me to focus on advocacy for my conditions, and building resources for people who suffer from them, while also being able to pay my bills. Since I launched this Patreon in February 2021, I have joined the board of directors for the US Spinal CSF Leak Foundation, and been able to write about my additional diagnoses¬†of¬† mast cell activation syndrome  and Ehlers Danlos Syndrome on my own site, both unpaid. I've also had the pleasure of building out this community of lovely people, sharing¬†resources about pain, insomnia, anxiety, and more, prompted by the thoughtful questions of this community.¬† Many of you have asked how you can help support me since the spinal CSF leak changed my life. If you‚Äôve enjoyed my soup recommendations, my years of ad-free writing on Legal Nomads (or sharing on social media), or simply want to help, my Patreon is the best way to provide support. I would be honoured for you to join this wonderful community. If you're a new reader or found this page via my writing about chronic pain, I hope this community helps support you and provide strategies that make life a little bit easier.

More about Legal Nomads For those new to Legal Nomads, my business started out as a website, built in 2008 just before I set out on what I thought would be a one year trip around the world. It was meant to be a fun space to share my misadventures with family and friends during a sabbatical from the law. That one year turned into several, and the blog organically turned into a creative and professional journey. It was beyond exciting to build something that allowed me to learn as much as possible every day, and share a view of the world that hopefully helped others to grow with me. As I floated further and further away from my legal background, it was also a time of entrepreneurial uncertainty I love writing, and that's part of what helped me take the leap. I would continue to write even if no one was reading. But thankfully, people  did  read. Over time, Legal Nomads flourished and was featured in newspapers and magazines, and I moved into public speaking about community-building and the neuroscience of storytelling. For over a decade, I travelled around the world full time, guided by insatiable curiosity and my appetite. I researched eating as a celiac in Portugal, Thailand, Japan, and elsewhere, building gluten free guides for those who wanted to follow in my footsteps, and detailed celiac translation cards in a dozen languages. I spent quite a few of those years in Vietnam, and the latter part of the decade in Oaxaca, Mexico ‚Äî both to learn, share, and hopefully help readers navigate the world differently through food, even with celiac disease. I kept the site ad-free and without pop-ups or sponsored text links, focusing income instead on products I built that readers asked for, like a book about food, hand-drawn maps of (you know it‚Ä¶) food, and guides to some of my favourite places to eat in and visit. More about Spinal CSF Leaks I also wanted to share a bit more about my prognosis, for those who may be interested in understanding it better. My¬†cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak¬†causes me incredible pain when I am standing up. I am left with very little ‚Äòuptime‚Äô, the standing time required to live my days. CSF is a liquid that bathes and supports the brain and spinal cord, protected by a membrane that keeps the CSF where it‚Äôs supposed to be. When there is a hole in that membrane, the CSF seeps out ‚Äì a CSF leak.¬† What does this CSF leak in my spine do? For starters, it means that every time I stand, the low CSF volume causes my brain to painfully ‚Äòsag‚Äô. It also leads to other symptoms like dizziness, nausea, nerve pain, blurred vision, and impaired balance.  I went from building a business I loved while traveling the world, to spending 23 hours of my day in bed.¬† The fix for a spinal CSF leak is a blood patch, where they inject blood into your epidural space and it seals the leak site. For some, surgery. Some people have chronic CSF leaks where the procedures do not stick for a variety of reasons.¬†I am one of those people. As you can imagine, it‚Äôs a stark difference, and has required a lot of effort during the last few years just to accept and adjust my mindset to the limitations of my present. I¬†had four procedures, but I am still leaking. I have not yet returned for a fifth procedure due to other complications, which sadly make the treatment even more risky for me. This also fuels my desire to keep researching innovative ways to approach pain with my conditions, and with your help, to keep sharing those findings with the world.¬† You can read more about what happened to me¬† here , and can learn more from the Spinal CSF Leak Foundation,¬† here .¬†", "amount_post": 48, "amount_subs": 298, "price_tiers": [{"title": "Bob", "monthly": "$5", "description": "BOB THE BLUEBIRD.¬† You love bluebirds, and want to support me while learning more about chronic pain.¬† You'll get: ‚û°Ô∏è¬† Access to all prior and future Patreon updates. ‚û°Ô∏è  EARLY ACCESS to Legal Nomads details and news. ‚û°Ô∏è¬† Access to longer (20+ minute) AMA videos answering your questions about travel, chronic pain, CSF leaks or anything else!

The second one ( The Carp-Faced Boy and Other Tales ) was a finalist for The Bram Stoker Award (2017). I'm a Clarion West ('15) graduate, Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley Scholarship recipient, and a podcaster at¬† Uncanny Japan . What I want to do is introduce you to parts of Japan your probably don't know about. I want to show you all the cool, weird, creepy stuff, the uncanny. This is me: I'm an American expat writer who has spent half my life in a small Japanese fishing town. And by 'small fishing town' I mean a place where every day it feels like I'm stepping back in time. This is old Japan where the line that divides myth from reality isn't just blurred it's nonexistent. Superstitions and legends have been passed down for generations, and they continue to affect daily life. This is a culture where I had to change the floor plans to my house because the kitchen door was sitting in a northeast direction ‚Äì also known as the  Kimon¬† or Devil's Gate ‚Äì and would surely invite rancid luck into my home. It's a society where one day, apropos of nothing, my mother-in-law declared me \"sticky\" and insisted I have an exorcism because I attract ghosts. This coexistence of ancient and modern has fascinated me for the past twenty six years, and I‚Äôve used my fluency in the language to study the parts of Japan which have yet to be revealed to Western audiences. I‚Äôm a professional  writer *¬†who adores this mythic world ‚Äì one that has informed my stories for years ‚Äì and am sitting on a treasure trove of untranslated information. Using this Patreon, I want to bring these gems to you in three ways: 1 ‚Äì  Podcast My biweekly podcast ‚Äì  Uncanny Japan  ‚Äì is where I share these odd bits of research. What makes my podcast different is that I record them while wearing binaural mics. This means that as I sit by the shore, hike through the mountains, or even watch a local festival, you'll be with me, learning about Japan, and experiencing the soundscapes exactly as I do.  2 ‚Äì Art I adore making postcard-sized pictures depicting all the strange creatures and beautiful characters of Japan. These days I do  hanga  carvings, brush and inks, or Japanese  etegami -watercolors. These will be available in the Rewards section. Below are a few of my creations.¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† \n\n3 ‚Äì¬† Writing \n Dearest to my heart is the writing: my short stories and novels. Here is where I combine all of my research with my\n26-years of living in Japan and weave you a tale. (See below for my already published and soon-to-be-published works).¬† \n Your pledges through Patreon\nand engagement as readers and listeners will provide me the support to pursue my passion for creating art: recording¬† my podcasts , painting freaky postcards, and\nwriting dark, uncanny stories and novels.¬† \n \n\nYou\nhelp¬† me , and I promise to use these three mediums to introduce you to all the weird secrets lurking in the nooks and\ncrannies of Japan. \n \n\nThank you, \n \n\nThersa *¬† ¬† 2017¬† Finalist for The Bram Stoker Award short story collection : The Carp-Faced Boy and Other Tales * ¬† ¬†Graduate of¬† Clarion West (2015) .¬† * ¬† ¬†Recipient of¬† HWA's Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley Scholarship.   * ¬† ¬†Author of¬† A Robe of Feathers and Other Stories  (Counterpoint LLC, 2009).¬† * ¬† ¬†My second collection ‚Äì The Carp-Faced Boy and Other Tales ‚Äì (Independent Legions Press,¬† ¬†February 2017). * ¬† ¬†I've also had stories\npublished in various magazines and anthologies ( Black Static , The Fortean Times,¬† The Madhouse Anthology  and¬† The Beauty of Death Anthology  to name a few.) *¬† ¬† ¬†My retelling of the Japanese horror tale, \"The Wife Who Didn't Eat\" appears in the¬† A World of Horror Anthology .¬† *¬† ¬† ¬†My serialized story \"Sara and the In-Between\", ran in Asahi Weekly from July through September.

My name is Ben Komets and I am a professional miniature artist based in Berlin, Germany. You may know me from video tutorials I have done for Paintingbuddha, companies like Miniature Mentor, or from one of the many classes I have taught in different countries. Since starting two decades ago, I have laboured at my craft of painting miniatures and have won awards in dozens of painting competitions all over the world. Three years ago, I decided to go into miniature painting as a full time profession, painting box art miniatures for several miniature companies and private commission pieces at my home studio in Berlin. Now, I am pleased to announce that I will start to release my own small range of miniatures, working with world class sculptors to cater to all painters. ¬† WHY PATREON? I would like to show you how I work and what motivates me to push the boundaries of miniature art. I know that a lot of people follow my work in progress on Facebook daily as a source of inspiration, or study my techniques to become better painters. Even with the tutorials that have already been published, there is so much more to show you. Patreon is a great platform that allows me to produce the best material for you to improve your painting level based on your feedback, allowing me to invest more time in teaching and talking about miniatures. WHAT DO YOU GET? Your patronage gives you access to exclusive, detailed work in progress pictures and beautifully designed color guides for every model I paint, regular in-depth tutorials and video tutorials paired with Q&A sessions so you can engage with the entire process, start to finish with easy-to-follow and comprehensive teaching material; drawing on two decades of knowledge and passion so that you can get your painting skills to the next level. And, in case you should need a little more guidance or personal feedback, there's also pledge level for that! Example PDF FUTURE PLANS As I'm still working on the technical set up here in the studio, to begin with I can guarantee one video OR detailed tutorial per month, forming the foundation of the course.

I look forward to offering behind-the-scenes viewing of work in progress, special classes and workshops, online soundbath sessions and more... About Me I grew up at Bhaktivedanta Manor, a temple and spiritual community in England, founded on the teachings of bhakti-yoga. In my early years I attended the small temple school, in which we learned sacred mantras and teachings alongside our regular subjects.  From a very young age, I loved to draw and write and had the fortune to study classical music and dance (Eastern and Western) throughout my youth. All of these arts were nurtured in the environment of the temple, where especially music and chanting, played a vital role in daily life. I learned that the highest expression of art is to offer it in the service and glory of the Supreme.  After graduating from university in 2009, I faced a crossroads. I knew my heart felt called to become further immersed in the devotional arts, but I was very unsure and afraid of what that meant. A fateful meeting with sacred musicians, Gaura Vani, and The Mayapuris gave me the confidence to take a leap of faith, and travel around the world for the next two years supporting the sharing kirtan of everywhere from concert halls to psychiatric hospitals.  For twelve years now I have been blessed with the opportunity to serve \nthrough my artistic offerings. It's a calling that I wish to pursue in \nwhatever way possible for the rest of my life.  I believe that \nnow, more than ever, the world needs the healing, purifying vibration of\n the Divine names, and all kinds of art inspired by devotion. What is patronage? In the history of art, patronage refers to the encouragement or financial support that an organization or individual bestows to another. In centuries gone by, artists of all kinds were dependent on patronage to be able to focus on their creative work. In our modern day, the platform Patreon offers an amazing opportunity to become a part of the life and work of artists that you love.  As I continue to create and share, whether it be recording new music, facilitating experiences with kirtan and healing sound, creating visual art and more, I want to invite you to become co-creators. Please join me on the quest to bring more love and devotion to this world.  Thank you! I deeply value the culture of giving according to one's means as an act of generosity. This is the traditional system for sharing of knowledge and art in ancient times, and I believe it is just as relevant today. Therefore all patrons will be granted access to the entire content \nshared here, regardless of the level of sponsorship.  I am very grateful for whatever support you choose to offer!

These artworks and documentation are readily available on multiple social media platforms, including  Tumblr ,  Facebook ,  Twitter , and  Medievalpoc.org . The goal of Medievalpoc is not to  hoard  information, but to share it as widely as possible and incite discussion in social as well as activist and educational communities.  The traditional relationship between creators and their patrons have long been a part of human history. With the advent of social media, the opportunity to not only share these creations with a massive audience, but to actively engage with and become a  part  of the creative process, is both unprecedented and old as humankind. Patronage will provide the opportunity to not only bring Medievalpoc to a wider audience online, but the ability to travel for appearances at academic and literary conventions, speak at functions, and facilitate activist work in face-to-face environments. Patronage means more access to databases, art collections, and academic resources for the creation of Medievalpoc. In addition, your patronage can pave the way for exciting new projects across various media, like print, film, and interactive online content--projects Patrons can see in the making. Patrons of Medievalpoc will have a unique access to the creation of Medievalpoc, the research and writing process, as well as interviews, discussions, theory writing, rough drafts and brainstorming. Patrons can give feedback on projects as they happen. Creator Goals will be added and enhanced as new projects take shape and become realized through the unique processes that shape discussions at Medievalpoc. With patronage, Medievalpoc will be better able to expand its platforms and run more smoothly across social media sites, with improved synchronization and accessibility.  I look forward to forging a new era of Patron and Creator with my readers in my goal of bringing Art and History to life in a new way-a History in which we can see ourselves.", "amount_post": 27, "amount_subs": 286, "price_tiers": [], "tags": "", "socialmedias": []},

My name is Mateusz Urbanowicz and I make paintings, illustrations, animations, comics, and sometimes DIY art-related projects. I'm Polish but currently, I'm based in Enoshima near Tokyo, Japan. I have been living in Japan for almost 10 years and I'm trying to capture its beauty in my works. I have been working as a full-time background artist for animated TV series (for example \"Space Dandy\") and movies (like \"Your Name.\") but decided to focus on my own art and start a freelance artist career in 2017. Since then I directed short animations, did paintings, comics, and art-related videos but most importantly published watercolor art books like the \"Tokyo Storefronts\" and ‚ÄúTokyo at Night‚Äù. The main goal of this Patreon campaign is to maximize the amount of time I can spend on my personal art projects that I can share with you! Also, I want to show you how I make my art so you can learn and hopefully get some inspiration from my process. I want to use Patreon to directly answer questions you might have about me or my art. With the time I get thanks to your donations here, I plan to make more illustrations (painted by hand with watercolors, gouache, etc. and sometimes digitally) comics (available for you online and in printed form) books, zines, and prints of my art videos showing you my art-making process, tutorials, and video lessons much more other stuff! and then share it all with you!

I understand that not everyone is in a position to financially support the artists they love... if that's the case, no sweat. I still really appreciate your support in every other way. Whether that's you spreading the word, sharing a link, or even just blasting poetry at a stop sign through your open car window (which is so literary gangster by the way)... it all helps and is very much appreciated. I'm guessing that a lot of you know me because of other work I've done, To This Day, Troll, Heaven or Whatever, Shoulders, and the like. I get asked a lot to make more videos or record more pieces or re-record pieces to make them classroom friendly. Believe me when I tell you that there's almost nothing else I want to be doing, but you guessed it... it's costly. I work with a lot of amazing people and am always trying to expand my collaborative horizons, but we're all limited in how much of our time we can donate. As much as I'd like to be paid for what I do I would also really like to pay the people who help me do it. Yes, I write the poems, but there's a lot of other magic that goes into the videos, music, and illustrations. When I say magic I mean really hard work done by monstrously talented individuals whom I love. So why should you pledge? So we can keep doing it. There's a ton of projects I'd like to get off from the drafting board and into actual production, but i need your help to do it.  Here's a short list of things I'd like to do with your support: Podcast Videos Audio Recordings Short Films Web Series Graphic Novel Children's Book Feature Film Documentary Animations Illustrated Poems I think the \"per thing\" method makes more sense than the monthly path. Some projects will just take longer than others so it will help keep the pressure off and insure the quality of each creation. Sometimes you can end up cutting corners if you're trying to reach a deadline... this just makes sure that I won't have to do that.

I then create a new post  and we all have a  discussion  about the details of the image. After the discussion I create a  thumbnail sketch  based on all the feedback. Then I draw up a  pencil sketch , while still sticking to the general layout of the thumbnail: After this stage I will ask everyone if there are any other small things they think should be added, then move onto the final colour, here's a  closer look at some details   (I did a version with and without rain): Bespoke Fillers: As well as the main piece I also create  colour fillers  (plus card art version)  and  line-art fillers  for  bespoke filler tiers  to  their specifications  (I have very limited numbers of these, but will hopefully be opening up more).

Hi there, my name is Jmenaru. I've been creating mods for games since 2012 and have been doing 3D Art and Modelling for the past 10 years.¬† What am I making ? Over time, I have created armors, clothing, weapons, props and environment art for games. While I primarily make armors and clothing mods for female characters every once in a while I will do weapons or other items.  I tend to focus on quality and generally like to take my time with everything I create to make sure it holds up for gameplay and close-up screenshots. What game am I currently modding ? For now, my main game is Fallout 4, so all my mods will be made to work for that by default. This can and will change with time. Why am I finally creating a Patreon page ? Even though I absolutely love doing 3D for games, as is with all things, with time, the motivation to keep going drops and burnout sets in. Having a Patreon page will give me an additional reason to keep creating new mods for you to enjoy consistently, while also helping me to invest in new hardware to provide better mods at a faster rate. What will you be getting as a patron ? I will have a new mod for my patrons to use every month, depending on current project difficulty, scope and time constraints. If you pledge, you will also gain access to any previous posted content immediately, depending on tier. You can find all current releases using the \" All-Releases \" tag, which contains public posts with images and links for every release. A more detailed description of the different tiers ? A higher tier will include previous lower tier benefits. All tiers give a special role on the Discord Server. - The  $1 tier  gets you access to work in progress images of upcoming mods, being able to vote on possible upcoming projects or suggest a project of your own (more info¬† here ). This is for people that want to stay up to date with what I'm currently working and influence future projects. - The  $5 tier  gets you access to (generally completed) early access mods that will eventually be publicly uploaded here for all to use. The early access period is arbitrary and can be anywhere from 1 to 3-4 months. This is for people that want to experience my mods as soon as possible. - The  $10 tier  gets you access to exclusive mods that will never be publicly released anywhere else. Additionally, I will credit you in my mod descriptions. This is for people that want to have everything I am making or can offer. What are your asset use permissions ? You can use all my assets in your own projects(for whatever purpose you want: mashups, conversions, retextures etc) and upload those mods anywhere you see fit, without seeking direct permission from me, provided you respect all of the conditions mentioned bellow: 1) Standalone use of my assets is not allowed, your mod must require the original to function (for example, if you do mesh work, leave the textures out of your release, etc). This obviously forbids ports to other games. 2) Usage of my texture files (or anything based on my texture files) is not allowed for mods in early access unless they've been publicly released (you can still use meshes). After their public release you may use the asset's texture files. 3)¬†Usage of my texture files (or anything based on my texture files) is not allowed for mods under the exclusive tier (you can still use meshes). If you can't meet the above requirements then you must contact me for permission before using my files.

Supporting me on Patreon not only allows me to keep doing this stuff, but lets me keep it free while giving backers exclusive access to project updates, alpha tests, and all kinds of cool stuff. So, if you believe in that work too, and you like what I‚Äôve made so far, please consider supporting my efforts on here, or making a one-time contribution¬† here .

That is also why I love telling stories and\nhiding secrets in my pieces, just for you to find, like a sneaky secret we can\nshare. \n\nFreelance illustrating for me means I spend\n90% of my time working alone (well, the goblins are there, but they aren‚Äôt much\nhelp), but the joyful reactions and requests I get from folks that love what I‚Äôm\ndoing make me feel quite the opposite! \n\nAnd, SEGWAY ALERT, this is why I‚Äôve started\nthis Patreon page! \n\nI‚Äôve had an amazing first year of freelancing;\nI feel like I have the support of the most awesome fan base there is, and I\nwant to use more of my time making the things you guys have been asking for!

This patreon page is my best\nstab at creating a space for all of us nerds with a dark side, where a manageable\namount of your hard earned money can help me feed those goblins, make some new\nthings, AND give some of those creations straight to you! \n\nIn fact, if you browse through the tiers here,\nyou‚Äôll find that I‚Äôll be creating special things EXCLUSIVELY for you each\nmonth! I‚Äôll also be sharing the methods behind the madness and behind the\nscenes stuff that no one else gets to see, and giving you the greatest say in\nwhat I make next! \n\nI really truly hope you‚Äôll become a patron & join me on this\nstrange and unusual journey to make art and purchase goblin food!

I have been featured multiple times in an SCP themed PC game called\n‚ÄúSCP: Containment Breach‚Äù ‚Äì in this game I voice several characters (\n https://scpcb.gamepedia.com/Voice_Actors )\nbut the one I am most known for is the mysterious Plague Doctor ‚ÄúSCP-049‚Äù.  \n Ok, the main reason i'm starting Patreon as a means of support (apart from people asking) is that I want to make better content for my listeners - because the more financial support I receive, I can take more requests, vastly improve the quality of my work and create artwork to accompany my videos (i've been learning Blender for a year now in an effort to create photo realistic images that enhance the realism/immersion of my work) ... all of this means better content that you will enjoy! Not to mention (OK, i'll mention it) the rewards you will get exclusively from Patreon, so this can only be a positive step forward. Over the past year ‚Äì I have been gradually stepping up\nmy production ambition for videos and as I have done this I have become aware\nthat due to the horror nature of my videos, they are being deemed inappropriate\nby certain ad companies (even though to my knowledge I have made my content adhere\nto their advertising guidelines), this makes it much harder for me to continue\nmaking content with certain themes.\n \nThat being said ‚Äì I know there is still an audience for what\nI do!. So I have decided to open a means of support for people that appreciate\nwhat I do. I have set up a number of rewards for people that might like to\nsupport me (and who knows, if this is successful ‚Ä¶ it might end up making the\nchannel even better!).¬† Thank you for reading and I hope you choose to support me - i'm 99% certain you won't regret it. -Aaron \"TheVolgun\" McKee \n \n", "amount_post": 21, "amount_subs": 274, "price_tiers": [{"title": "Class-D", "monthly": "$2", "description": "Access to my patron feed ¬†and a ‚ÄúPatron‚Äù role on my discord server!¬†"}, {"title": "Junior Researcher ", "monthly": "$5", "description": "You get a named credit at the end of my videos!

My name is Kat. Some of you may know me from The Voice. Some of you may know me from my fabulous San Francisco/Seattle/LA variety show, Misfit Cabaret. Some of you may know me from seeing me trek up and down the east coast in my very first band, The Design. Or maybe you just stumbled upon this page and are intrigued. HELLO! I have a Patreon.  Why?  I want to release new art to you (songs, music videos, and other artistic endeavors) without you having to wait. I plan on releasing a thing every 3-4 months, and I'll always give Patreon backers a heads up! Misfit Cabaret  is a wild variety rock opera for which I write two new original songs for every new show. Each show is themed, and I write within the parameters of the theme. For instance- we have a cult film variety show called Cinephilia, so I wrote songs about¬† Edward Scissorhands  and¬† photo journalists turning war into art . For Whimsea, our nautical themed show, I wrote a song about a real life¬† underwater ballroom tragedy , and a song about¬† David Bowie on a beach  (he had just passed away, I wanted/needed to write a song for him, and parameters have workarounds). For A Very Bloody Misfit Cabaret, I wrote a song about Stephen King's Carrie White and a song about¬† alcohol in the form of a succubus .  For the first 10 songs from Misfit Cabaret, I released a heavy full length album through Kickstarter ( CHECK IT OUT! ).  Now that we're doing a brand new¬† Misfit Cabaret  every two months, the music is flowing fast, and rather than wait an entire year or two to release all of the new songs on another album and do yet another giant KS campaign, I would love to record them one at a time and give them to you as soon as they are ready to be released. Patreon is perfect for this. The first song I released through Patreon was¬† \"What An Excellent Day For An Exorcism\" , along with \"King\" and¬† \"Criminal\" .¬† In addition to releasing new music, I also want to create cinematic music videos for some (or all) of the Misfit Cabaret studio recordings. Incredible videographers in the Bay Area have approached me with ideas that I'm over the moon for, and I would love to create visual art to go along with each of these songs. Since the launch of my Patreon, we have funded and released a music video for \"Artists\", \"Song For David Bowie\", \"Criminal\", \"King\" and \"What An Excellent Day For An Exorcism\".¬† In supporting this Patreon, you are not only supporting me as an artist, you are also supporting the Bay Area artist community. Having the funds to record new songs and create new videos means I get to employ local artists‚Äì just as Misfit Cabaret employs local performers and gives them a big gorgeous stage to dazzle on.¬† Thank you for your support!

How much will this cost me?¬† Is it a monthly charge? ANSWER: There are two ways of setting a Patreon up- one is a monthly cost and one is a pay-per-thing. I went with the pay per thing option because I'm only going to be putting something out once every 3-5 months. I wouldn't want people to pay monthly if they're not receiving anything.

Here is a link to an older issue so you can get a feel for what it's like. https://madmimi.com/p/c18543 and here are some kudos from regular readers: Nest is the present I open on Monday morning at work. I purposely restrain myself from opening it on Sunday night so that I have something bright to look forward to the next day. I need to read it in one glorious helping, all at once and then save one of the photos as my screen saver to enjoy all week long. The best part of The Nest is how it makes me think and want to create, and look at things from a different angle. Every single issue has given me something to ponder, long after I've finished reading and I find the honesty and openness brave and refreshing.\" Karen Ercolano \"A surge of energy flows through me as I open Nest¬†and see the beautiful color photography of flowers and fruits and vegetables gently nestled in descriptive prose.

Others are taking their first steps towards building careers as practicing artists. Some are already there. Our journeys all started at our studios in Florence, Sweden, or New York. Each of these amazing spaces nurtured our individual visions and gave us the skills to reach our full artistic potential.   We have created a symbiotic platform between artists and patrons to give you access to our techniques, our process and to the amazing new works we are creating.

Where I share all of my art and how I make it! The majority of the sketches I create do not make it to social media. Mainly because it's very personal and I frequently get sucked into the process of creating. Patreon is a place for me to share the art journey as it unfolds. Through Patreon, you can become an active supporter of my art and take a peek behind the curtain of how the magic happens.  Via Patreon Lens - I chat a lot about my thought process in the moment of creating a painting.  I share a plethora of my knowledge I've accumulated as an independent artist and from my time at Ringling College of Art and Design as an Illustration student. Along with Lens,  I document the development of my paintings in the Sketchbook PDF.   You'll find scans of the initial rough sketch, the tight sketch right before painting, and many scans showcasing the multiple layers of my watercolor process. The Sketchbook PDF also includes my practice studies and prep work for my final illustrations. On top of that, you also get  access to a VIP Discord channel  where we all chat and hangout. Its seriously AMAZING!!! Since its exclusive to Patrons Only, it's a close knit community. Need feedback on your artwork or recommendations on art supplies, ask on the Patron Discord! It's also where I hang out and chat with Patrons. Things to know! Payments are charged as soon as you pledge, then renew at the beginning of the following month on the 1st.  Physical rewards are mailed once the month is over so I have an accurate count on the Limited Edition Postcards. For example¬†December Postcard will be mailed in January, usually around the 15th. You can cancel or change your pledge at any time. For example, one month you might feel adventurous and want the Sketchbook PDF, go for it! You will be charged the difference upon upgrading.

I'll guess you've already listened to the podcast, that we share a love of good, true, and beautiful things, that we're in the trenches of life together, seeking to \"rejoice though we've considered all the facts\" (Wendell Berry). I have a hunch that you care about cultivating your interior life, enriching your soul, becoming a source of wisdom and kindness for others. I also have a hunch you may know that I (Joy) am in the throes of finishing a Phd in Theology, Imagination, and the Arts at St Andrews University on the sparkling coast of Scotland. If so, welcome to my Patreon.¬† Patreon provides a platform for you to support my work and share in my journey toward completing a Phd.  You can find out more about each tier of Patreon through the tabs on the right, but first, let me tell you the story of how Patreon came to be, what I do on Patreon, and what you can expect from this community. In 2017, passionate about the power of story and beauty to help shape us into well-rounded people who think with complexity and compassion about the world, I started  Speaking with Joy.  A brand new doctoral student in theology at the cusp of an academic career, I could never have imagined what a life giving force this podcast would become in my own life, deepening my convictions, strengthening my voice, and connecting me with kindred spirits all over the world. But I also couldn't have imagined how much completing a doctorate would require of me:  intellectually, emotionally, socially, financially. Completing a Phd can be a profoundly isolating experience. Conflicting forces pull you in two directions at once, toward the hurricane's eye of a research vortex on the one hand, and into the storm of training, presenting, and speaking to make sure you (and your CV) are ready to get a job when you're done. And while this storm rages you also have to work enough to eat, go to church, and sometimes even hang out with friends (lol it's 2020... who are we kidding?!). It is no wonder Phd students are¬† three times more likely than others to be anxious or depressed. At the end of my first year, I realised that I needed financial support on this journey if I was going to be able to finish the Phd on time and maintain a modicum of sanity. I knew I wanted to continue producing the podcast, but that I couldn't do that unless it became a source of income. I could not sustain producing the podcast, attending to my academic duties, and working to provide for my day to day needs. I trusted that if the podcast really were worth my time, a part of my calling, God would provide, and people would come alongside me; God did, and you have.  Through the financial support of Patreon, I am able to continue my doctoral studies and the podcast. I also had an inkling that I needed a network of support, encouragement, and prayers, something to anchor me, and keep the vision clear for why I do what I do, both in research and in the podcast. This was the support I didn't know to ask for, the gift I was surprised and delighted to be given. Over the past year,  Patreon has become a source of immense encouragement to me, given me a place to more privately (than the internet, writ large) to recount the victories and challenges of my studies, a community of people who have cheered me on and given me ideas. ¬† In thanks for the financial and verbal generosity of my patrons on this site, I enjoy sharing fun bits of extra \"content\" (I really despise this vacuous word): a monthly newsletter (the Joynal!), playlists, secret podcasts, recipes, pictures, and short essays. And this year (2020), I've started a new endeavour: a reading and discussion club!¬†Each week, I'll post a reading, a podcast on that reading, a short essay about it, and discussion questions. The readings will always be small, and available somewhere for free online. I started this after the wonderful success of this¬† year's summer book club on Julian of Norwich . (you can retroactively read the posts if you join). Generally speaking, the $2 tier involves playlists, Joynals, and booklists. And the $10 tier involves that AND the weekly secret podcasts. My patrons are my podcast inner circle. The first people I'll tell when things are on the move. The people I'll ask for prayers. The people upon whom I'll premier writing ideas. The patreon is not a \"product\" I produce for your purchase, it's a community of support, inspiration, and shared delight. I lean on my patrons, but I hope they enjoy stories and songs and ponderings I share in the leaning... and I love learning from you as well. Well, I'm rambling (a very realistic depiction of my patreon posts), but I hope that has given you a sense of what this space is for. If it sounds like something something you'd enjoy, join in! I'd love to have you along for the journey.  Oh, and you're all going in the acknowledgements of my Phd. Much love, friends.

A passion for myth, fantasy and legends were present at an early age, I vowed to become an artist...¬† I'm the creator of a book called  Faeries of the Faultlines .

And now I was going to add my voice to these stories. What began with daily sketches for #mermay and #junefae in 2016 opened up a world I started calling¬†the Faultlines. This Patreon page is giving me the opportunity to dive deeper into this world, to bring you the stories and show you the creatures that lurk behind root, stone,¬†mud and water.

I am Fluff-Kevlar / Fluff / Kev, a solo artist drawing mostly  adult/NSFW  anthro/furry artwork. I also draw other content such as MLP, human/anime, etc art from time to time. My original content centers around Sci-Fi and Tribal settings. I do not take any of this support for granted, and try very hard to create fun, unique content that I (and hopefully you) like! \n \n Goal of this Patreon- This and my SubscribeStar(another pledge option with mirrored content and bonuses) supports my bills, food, and general living expenses as a fleshy human. Self-employment is a heavy weight to swing, and your support goes into things that most jobs get already: sick days, retirement.. TAXES. \n \n How this works- \nI dislike pay-walled art; my work will always be posted \npublicly for free, usually a few months after Patreon. However, depending on the tier, you can  see work   earlier, vote, give feedback,  join some private streams , see any alternate versions,  and  in   higher resolutions ! This way, I can say \"thank you\" without turning my art into a paywall. Only pledge what you think my work is worth!  I will do my best to make it worthwhile. Every dollar counts, and every patron is equally important to me, since I know people change tiers all the time. At the beginning of each month I'll post here,  in my Patreon Feed , a link to a ZIP file of all the art made in the previous month. My Patreon charges upfront, so you'll be able to see the post right away if your pledge processes. Just scroll down my feed to the beginning of each month and find the Sketch, HD, or PSD post for your tier. Or to find a month quickly, use the  \"reward\" tag  when viewing my posts. \n\t \n\t I f you want some old content-   For each month you pledge, you can PM me on Patreon requesting  one previous month 's content (of your same tier). For example, if you pledged in July, you'd have access to July, and can also request, say...February's content in addition. You can also buy the most recent several month's HD ZIP files from my E-Junkie store \n\t HERE . \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t In short- \n\t\t\tThe goal is to provide \n\t\t\t everyone  with the best art that I can do, that would otherwise not be funded, while giving those that  do  donate some extra files and bonuses as a \"Thank you\" for letting me do this full time! \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t[To send me a PM, click the 'Overview' tab,  \n\t\t\tand then the box that says \"More\" under my icon. \n\t\t\tThere you'll see the 'message' option.]\n\t\t \n\t \n", "amount_post": 2, "amount_subs": 1, "price_tiers": [{"title": "Early Sketchbook", "monthly": "$1", "description": "Want to support me but can't offer much?

BAIA‚Äôs mission is to document, preserve and promote the contributions of the African American arts community.  THE BLACK ART IN AMERICA (BAIA) FOUNDATION  is a 501c3 organization that applies what we‚Äôve learned over our 12 years as a multifaceted arts company to facilitate the growth of artists while cultivating the relationships and opportunities that bring Black artists and communities together. THE BAIA FOUNDATION  believes that a significant challenge for communities of color is their lack of access to and education on the visual arts, particularly those that effectively reflect and represent themselves.  \n \n \n\t \n \n In the last 12 years, BAIA has generated thousands of hours of free, original content. This includes (but certainly is not limited to): BAIA Bits - ‚ÄúLittle moments where knowledge meets art‚Äù - We‚Äôve recently added audio with subtitles as well.  Three-Pieces, which feature background information and three artworks by artists who are represented by BAIA Featured articles, which cover interviews, gallery exhibits, and everything else related to the art world (visual art, fashion, music, interior design, and more) Profiles on artists, collectors, and industry professionals And, as of this year, thanks to Patrons like you, we've introduced our quarterly, nationally-distributed print version of BAIA The Mag. \n \n \n\t \n \n Goals of THE BAIA FOUNDATION:  To center the legacy of African-American art and artists through visual art, literature, lesson plans, oral histories, and the distribution of our bi-monthly magazine To promote intersections between art and activism in Black neighborhoods and schools while encouraging a strong sense of purpose and unity and using art as a catalyst for economic development To create opportunities for Black artists and writers to grow by facilitating their skill sets, giving them the space and tools to create, and expanding their professional networks. 2022 ‚Äì Initiatives: Distribute BAIA, the mag, to the 107 HBCUs in the country Design art centered lesson plans for middle schools, summer camps, and homeschoolers  Fund artists lead community impact based workshops and programs targeting the youth and seniors  Launch (virtual) professional development series Institute marketing assistance for African American Museums and Cultural Centers.  How to Get Involved: Become a stakeholder who helps us transform lives through art.  Becoming a Patreon contributor. \n\t \n\t \n\t Everything we do at BAIA happens, in part, because of the support we get from our Patreon contributors.

I'm a 3D artist and I love making toys. I've been making art toys for over a year now with my 3D printer, it's so much fun to see my imagination coming to life. So I decided to not keep all the little creatures for myself, and I want to share my designs and see other versions from everyone who loves making toys as well. In order for me to keep creating all the fun little Grumpii monsters for you guys, I will need your support. By supporting me, you are helping Grumpii improve as an artist and grow as a brand. Creating is always my passion, and you are supporting my dream. I'm so excited to share my passion with you all and I'm super thankful for your support!!! What do you get? - You will have access to the monthly release. - Access to the  Current  month. For example, if you join my Patreon in August (current) you will get access to August only, you can't access July or months before that. If you  FORGET  to download the files or  MISS  the designs from all the months before that, you will have to purchase them separately. I will be listing them online, not all designs will be listed. (discount codes for patrons only) How many designs do I get? - I will release 3~4 original designs every month. When does the download link expire? -  11:59 PM  EST  at the end of every month. I recommend not signing up for Patreon at the last minute. Patreon will charge you for the next month instead which will cause a lot of confusion. What happens if I forget to download the file? -  Please don't forget to download and save your files somewhere safe. If you forget/miss/lose the files, they will be gone next month, I will close all access to the previous download links. What about fanart? - I will spend 99% of my time creating original designs, but if fanart is what you all really like, I will let you guys vote on that. Where are my files? - You will be able to download the files directly from Patreon.

Indiemono started as an independent Spotify profile where we hosted different playlists from our curation, frequently updated and focused in different music genres and moods - now it's the base channel you need to visit to understand who we are...  you may find a playlist for your exact mood today!    ¬† \n \nWhen we began our journey, we started receiving hundreds of messages from artists and bands, undiscovered and with the need of help. So we decided to focus our path on them, as the music industry nowadays has a really small pool of artists and there is enough highlight for them. There is a lot of work done and in progress like \n creating a solid community of independent curators  to give a boost to the talent, a¬† music submission system  for us to sort, review and feed playlists with those songs and the  editorial power to display and show all of it  through our site.\n \n \nNow, our new path is \n building the best and fairest digital label of all times . We're considering artists and establishing a solid network of promotion. Our future will be promoting them and introduce them to the world, so stay tuned! \n \n We're a small team of two \n \n \n Carlos , who is the curator and the builder of Indiemono's music ecosystem vision - He's filled with discipline and real passion for music. He basically spends his time working around playlists, attending concerts and planning trips around the world. He has the most amazing ideas for innovation around music and he's so eager to make them happen. \nAnd me,\n  Dam , a geek that loves design, illustration and literature. I currently work in projecting systems to make our life easier and be able to do more with less. I also talk with the people who connects with us and take care of the art. My free time is for video games and my recently built little urban orchard right¬†at the heart of Madrid. \n \nIt's just us and our time, so we need a little help to keep our system and, with a little luck, be able to devote 100% of our time to Indiemono.¬†¬†\n \n \n \n So, what do we need? \n \n A lot of work is needed to give foundations to our vision of equity and justice in the music industry, so we're officially opening our Patreon to ask you for help in sharing the journey with us. What we can promise you is that you'll find amazingly talented artists and bands that are eager for you to take a listen and give them feedback. If you're able to support us with 1$ a month it would mean a lot to us. We'll be opening new tiers, rewards and features really soon!¬†¬† We appreciate your support and love even if you can't contribute as a patron. \n \n \n \n So welcome, we hope you like it here.", "amount_post": 41, "amount_subs": 237, "price_tiers": [{"title": "Monthly Banana", "monthly": "$1", "description": "üçå A banana a month.

Creating  free and low-cost resources on herbalism and magickal arts  is nourishing work that I am called to. Teaching students and facilitating magickal gatherings both  online  and  in-person  feels right deep down in my bones. Soon I‚Äôll be celebrating a decade of running  Worts + Cunning Apothecary  and this year I want to start a new tradition. Some of you may already be familiar with the tradition I‚Äôm about to describe and for others of you it‚Äôll be a bit of a strange and unfamiliar concept. I want to be able to pay all my bills and have enough money leftover to create new things (A documentary style podcast on magickal culture! A book you can hold in your hands and spill tea on! Magickal gatherings featuring nice people doing kind things!). I then want to go even further (beyond easily paying my bills and doing things like taking regular time off and  not  doing things like walking around with a cracked tooth for months because I can't afford to go to the dentist) and collaborate with and compensate other people in creative endeavors. I have begun to realize that this thing of financial security is a thing that can be done and I‚Äôm interested in doing it.  I want to be able to easily run my business for decades to come while still having the majority of what I create given away for free.  In the process of creating such space to breathe and create in my life I want to help make it happen in the lives of others, too. By becoming a patron you would be helping to cast a circle wide enough for me to create more and give back to our community in ways that is sustainable and engaging.  I want to create more quality in your life and not just make more noise (except, when we need some holy sacred irreverent blissful noise). ¬† I would continue to create free and low-cost content, design new classes, and finally do the projects I feel called to but have felt unable to pursue because of financial instability. As our community grows you‚Äôll know that you‚Äôre not only supporting me, but the other folks I support through free and low-cost classes and services as well as the many other causes I rally behind (like community herbal clinics, Black Lives Matter, justice work at the border, and queer and sober gathering places). In the short term, the projects that I will be working on through the support of patrons like you are: A Book ( finally ) No one is surprised that I‚Äôm trying to write a book. But I‚Äôve been surprised (and not surprised at all) at how hard it is to write a book with the dread of financial instability hanging over one‚Äôs head. I want to write a book - even though I‚Äôm terrified to write a book - and I‚Äôm going to do it. Patron support will help me spend more time on book writing! More High Quality Free Resources for Plant Nerds, Modern Witches, and Tired Hags Patron support means that I get to keep doing what I (and presumably you) love: creating the type of content that inspires folks to know their magick, trust their story, and reweave themselves back into their communities. I want to write more about creating accessibility in our practices both professional and personal so we can show up to the world in all of wonder and weirdness. Right now my blog work is unpaid work - having financial backing means that I could expand what I‚Äôm doing in a way that promotes longevity and not burnout in my life. That would be rad. I'd also like to be able to offer all of my in-person classes as donation based with no one turned away for lack of funds because the ability to folks to gather together in supportive spaces is needed now more than ever.¬† So you‚Äôre invited to become a patron, join the club of me being ridiculously grateful for your support, and make the work that I do even more possible than it is now.  I am so excited for what we might create together - thanks for choosing to come along. In mirth + reverence, Alexis J. Cunningfolk Just in case you arrived here unexpectedly in the middle of the night or from a parallel but distinct enough dimension where I'm a cool and suave barista by day and superhero by night and not an herbalist and you have no idea who I am or what I do (intersectional herb- what?), here is a brief synopsis: My name is Alexis J. Cunningfolk (she/they) and I'm an intersectional herbalist and witch who runs  Worts + Cunning Apothecary . Through the practices of herbal healing, magickal arts, and sound therapies both ancestral and modern, I help folks to re-enchant the world and their lives by re-membering themselves back home through their magick. My work is informed by my queerness, mixed ancestry, and that I'm a young hag just waiting for time to catch up.

My focus at first will be on producing narrated easy to follow Pastel Painting videos. Each month I will be producing two videos for only ¬£4 a month, by pledging you with gain full access to all my Tutorials...  1) A 4 hour long Pastel tutorial... all the complete¬† footage slowed down to almost realtime, as well as real time viewing in some of the important areas, enabling you to follow every mark I make. 2) As an extra thank you for pledging, I will produce an exclusive real-time video with real-time audio explaining my procedure step by step on a specific aspect of pastel painting and other information you might find useful.  I have over 30 years experience to share with you... so really excited about doing just that. How do I easily find the tutorials I want to see? Use¬† www.daveportersart.co.uk/patreon  to easily navigate to the tutorials you want to follow. Also, if you are considering becoming a patron you can use this website to check out the library of tutorials I have on Patreon and navigate from there.¬† What are the benefits? The video library will grow each month...¬† I will be uploading on the first Wednesday of each month an exclusive re-edited content for my Patreons, this will be an (approximately 4 hour long) full length video tutorial, which will be more in-depth than the ones on my YouTube channel, exploring from beginning to the finished artwork¬† All the footage will be uploaded so you can pause at any point to take a closer look. Along with real-time footage, there will also be very slightly speeded up footage to ensure you can still see every stroke and mark I make (the reason for this is so I can reduce the length to around 4 hours). Some of my work can take many hours to complete.¬† As an extra thank you for pledging... I will produce in the middle of each month a selective part or the whole footage of my free YouTube content footage but with real-time video and Audio so you can follow along in more detail and see step by step how I achieve the results in the moment plus the benefit of me explaining the method as I create the work... so enjoy and thanks for your support... it means the world to me.  :-) What will I gain from the experience? My passion is to help you develop your own unique style with creating realistic and soulful artwork by keeping everything nice and simple and uncomplicated. I use mainly three primary colours, the three complimentary colours and a few earth colours to create the realism. Keeping everything relaxed and harmonious is really important to me; I have been on a personal spiritual journey for over 30 years uncovering how the mind can influence our work and sense of well being, so I give pointers to help you to relax and embrace the joy of just being whilst drawing and painting. So for the price of a cup of coffee each month, I am offering my many years of experience at an affordable price. All this in one tier for just ¬£4+ VAT.¬† Unlocking exclusive re-edited content especially created just for my Patreons.¬† By pledging, this will open further exciting opportunities to focus on producing more detailed video content especially for you. How do the payments work? \n\nMonthly\nMembership: As a new patron, your payment will be processed on the day you\nbecome a patron which gives access to all the videos in my library, then on the\n1st of the month going forward.

I started drawing when I was knee-high to a grasshopper, but didn‚Äôt pick up my first brush until the age of eleven. For many years I have undertaken watercolour, oil, acrylic and graphite commissions and have painted portraits, landscapes and animals. I now paint as a full time artist and have over 40 years experience. I love every minute of my work! My\nPatreon channel allows me to pass on my passion for watercolours. I love to teach others the techniques I use\nto create my wildlife portraits, and love even more to see the results that they achieve.  I do much prefer to film myself painting whilst chatting away at the same time, rather than recording a voice-over after the painting is done. To me, the way I do this gives you the feeling as if you are with me, sat by my side whilst I chat to you showing you what to do.

I'm Micah. \n \nI've always interacted with the world by making things, and by taking them apart to understand them. This was my reality. I had a weird childhood, and it was hard for me to connect with other people, but I could make things. It was like I could make my own tiny worlds. \n \nIt wasn't really the things themselves that I got attached to. I loved that experience of deeply understanding something, of creating something new. It felt like a kind of motherhood that anyone could experience. I wanted to share that experience with other people. \n \nAt a really young age, my dad sparked my interest in electronics and computers, but I quickly got interested in areas that he didn't have expertise in. So I turned to books, but books were expensive and they could be hard to find, and they didn't necessarily go that deep into things. So I learned to teach myself by experimenting. \n \nMost things don't require a lifetime of experience to understand. Most things, you can look at and understand them without having to understand all the pieces because the people who built them didn't necessarily understand all the pieces. To me, this understanding really represents freedom: freedom from a world where other people control and own all the technology around you. \n \nI got inspired by the open source software movement really early on, and I've spent most of the last 15 years making things that are often weird and complicated, but that I can give away for free. I've been lucky enough to create a few things that have been useful to others. For a while, I ran a¬† service  that helped other open source developers coordinate their work. I made¬† Fadecandy , a board that helps people make LED art. Most of these projects don't leave any legacy beyond my experiences of creating them and all the things I learn from those experiences. \n \nAfter haphazardly barely graduating university in Colorado while I was mostly working on my own projects, I moved to California and I got a job in Silicon Valley. I worked on things that were useful to a lot of people, but that internal beauty that had become so important to me was actually being intentionally hidden now. It felt very antithetical to my being to be working in this environment where you tell people not to look too closely at the software you're giving them. I really want to create things where you encourage everything to be dissected and understood. It's a compliment if someone wants to use your work to try to understand the field. \n \nSo, after 7 years of working in Silicon Valley and San Francisco, I burned out, I quit my day job, and started trying to find other things that would keep me going. Various things: art projects, software projects, contracting projects and my own things. But the thing that I've found the most enjoyment out of might be creating¬† videos  that document the process behind what I do. This takes something that would often be very obscure and hard for me to share, and it lets me communicate in a way that I think can be both educational and engaging. \n \nMy favorite things to create are things that other creators will enjoy, because I so enjoy the experience of creating things itself that I want to pass that experience on to other people. I'm often creating my own tools because I push myself to try things that aren't easy yet, then I push myself to give those tools away and make them accessible. \n \nVideo has been a really rewarding medium for me because I can really I think effectively share those tiny details that I get so excited about. It makes it easy to really zoom in on a particular part of the experience that I think people might find especially interesting, and to share that in this very carefully prepared way. \n \nSo, Patreon, this is how you can help. If you support me then I can spend more time just making things that you want to learn about, making content that really showcases the process, the details behind that part that you love and that I love, and not just making things that are going to be paved over with something else. You'll help me make more videos about electronics, more videos about art, more videos about the process that I go through to take things apart and understand them. More open source tools for making things and for taking them apart. \n \nIt's also an experiment in whether I can create tools and inspirational materials that are useful for other weirdos out there like me, who didn't really fit into the normal system and didn't learn about computers from school, but might learn about computers if they had the ability to tinker in the right ways. I think with my particular skills and knowledge I can make something out there that isn't really like anything else you can find. \n \nSo, with your help, I can keep making this stuff. I can keep trying to inspire other people who might learn the same way I learn, and most of all help people realize that it's in their power to figure things out no matter what.", "amount_post": 46, "amount_subs": 224, "price_tiers": [], "tags": "", "socialmedias": []},

CONTENT ALREADY (2021) For an overview of what has been in 2021 (with links to videos), all available to patrons for as long as my Patreon exists:  What¬¥s Up for Patrons - Links and Overviews (December 2021 Update) | Maria Kvilhaug - Ladyofthelabyrinth on Patreon COMING PATREON CONTENT and other projects 2022 Last year, in 2020, I made an intro video for Patreon on YouTube for the winter solstice, where I presented my new project, namely the one where I wrote and produced lecture videos on Norse mythology and pre-Christian religion for paying patrons at my Patreon. Since one whole year has passed, I have decided to offer an update of what has happened, and where this is going. MORE AUDIO What is going to be new is a podcast with audio versions of my lectures as well as readings from my books, starting with The Hammer of Greatness and The Seed of Yggdrasill.   Two new books and one new edition of an old book are coming out in 2022! An improved, edited and corrected version of The Maiden with the Mead The Goddess Idunn in Poetry and Myth Great Knowledge - Stories of Seidr and Fj√∂lkyngi My name is  Maria Kvilhaug , and I am an author of both fiction and non-fiction, and a lecturer with an academic background, but working on my own. You could say I am also open for a mystical and spiritual approach to the myths of the past. They are deeply spiritual works of wisdom as far as I am concerned. I was born in 1975, what makes me 46 years old at the moment. I am Norwegian, and I do live in Norway, but because I had a decade of living in other countries and for various other reasons, I tend to write and present my lectures in English. Most recent interview with yours truly  here  ( Sacred You Podcast ) BOOKS PUBLISHED THE SEED OF YGGDRASILL  My readers know me mostly for my grand work on Old Norse poetical metaphors and how to use these to understand the deeper meanings of mythology, namely The Seed of Yggdrasill. THE MAIDEN WITH THE MEAD  Many of my readers are also aware of my earlier work, titled The Maiden with the Mead, which is about initiation rituals in the Poetic Edda and was, originally, a university thesis from 2004 (can be read for free online through  Oslo University Library ). NB! The Maiden with the Mead will be re-published by the  Three Little Sisters  in the start of 2022! THE POETIC EDDA - SIX COSMOLOGY POEMS  I have also written one book with translations of six Edda poems crammed with commentaries and explanations: The Poetic Edda: Six Cosmology Poems THE TRICKSTER AND THE THUNDERGOD  Then there is The Trickster and the Thundergod: Loki and Thor in Old Norse myths. This one presents all the myths in which Thor and Loki appear. Why the both of them? Because the two gods usually appear in the same myths, and often appear to be working together. BLADE HONER  Fortunately, some of my readers also know about my four novels which sort of make up a series that was intended to continue on, but which for economic and time- reasons has been postponed. The four books work very well on their own, however. Here are titles and links: 1.  The Hammer of Greatness 2.  My Enemy¬¥s Head 3.  The Hel Rune¬¥s Claim 4.  A Twisted Mirror  They portray life in the in the Norse-speaking settlement of Aldeigjuborg in Russia during the 790s, the very start of the Viking Age, when the V√¶ringja Rus were pirates and landless men who had their cultural origin in Sweden, but who were naturally also influenced by their exile and their pirate lifestyles. It is seen through the eyes of a little girl, Thord√≠s, who is fated to become a Thunder Priestess (Thorsgydja) and one of the women mound-laid at  Oseberg  in 834. THE THREE LITTLE SISTERS PUBLISHER All these books are now re-published with my wonderful publisher  The Three Little Sisters . They are also going to release a new edition of The Maiden with the Mead ‚Äì A Goddess of Initiation Rituals in Old Norse Myths, in 2022. I have asked for some time to go through it, since it was written back in 2004 and I may want to do a few editions now after 17 years. FREE STUFF LADYOFTHELABYRINTH YOUTUBE  Adding to that, I run a YouTube channel ‚Äì called The Lady of the Labyrinth, which was inspired by a Minoan title of a priestess from Crete; Labyrinthos Potnia. Before finishing The Seed of Yggdrasill, I published more than thirty YouTube lectures based on the research behind this book between, mostly, 2009 and 2013. WEBSITE  Then I went less active on YouTube for many personal reasons and because I was concentrating on my research and writings and articles ‚Äì there is a website where many of these articles are published; named after my novel series; Blade Honer.  Bladehoner.wordpress.com. LECTURES, VIDEOS AND BOOK PROJECTS SINCE WINTER SOLSTICE 2021AND COMING: PATREON All this work is free and there for the taking. But in order to continue writing books and making lectures, I had to start financing the time and work it took, because we all have to make a living, pay our bills, all that - and doing this on my spare simply became too taxing. So, I opened a Patreon. I have never regretted that! It has been a lot of work, producing one or two lectures every month - but it is the work that I love the most, and it has enabled me to get very close to finishing two new book manuscripts! I want to extend a great roaring THANKYOU THANKYOU  THANKYOU to the people who have helped me out by paying me a little for the work I put into it. THANKYOU. It almost feels like you saved my life. Really. And let me tell you about what you have done for me. The two new books that will be published - as a result of people being willing to pay for my lectures, are the following: IDUNN BOOK¬† Apart from a re-publishing of the Maiden with the Mead, there will be a book based on my Patreon lecture series  The Goddess I√∞unn in Poetry and Myth . This book will be published very shortly, in 2022! SEI√êR BOOK¬† The other book which may hopefully also get through within 2022 is based on my 2021 Patreon lecture series  Fj«´lkyngi ‚Äì Stories of Sei√∞r and Initiation . The manuscript for the first part will be ready in 2022, but I don‚Äôt know how fast the publisher will be able to get it out! I will get back to what this project is all about shortly. SUMMARIES Last year, in 2020, I made an intro video for the winter solstice, where I presented my new project, namely the one where I wrote and produced lecture videos on Norse mythology and pre-Christian religion for paying patrons at my Patreon. Since one whole year has passed, I have decided to offer an update of what has happened, and where this is going. THE NEW COMING BOOKS: Let us return to the projects based on lectures available on Patreon: 1. THE IDUNN BOOK AND LECTURE TRILOGY: The I√∞unn-book is based very closely on three lectures, each one about two hours long, that I published on Patreon in January and February 2021. If you are a patron, you may already be familiar with the content. If you are not, well, the videos are published on my Patreon, and you get the drift. Each lecture goes through one of the three sources in which I√∞unn is described; 1.  The Sk√°ldskaparm√°l 2. The Skaldic poem  Haustl«´ng , which represents one of our oldest sources to Norse mythology, having been composed in its present form before the year 900, 3. And then the much debated Edda poem  Hrafnagaldr √ì√∞ins.  Each source provides some new insights into the I√∞unn-lore. THE SEI√êR BOOK AND LECTURE SERIES: Over to Fj«´lkyngi. I am going to tell you what it is about very soon, but first the practical information: This book is based on the Patreon lecture series Fj«´lkyngi ‚Äì Stories of Sei√∞r and Initiation, which I began in March 2021, and which is still ongoing, although I am getting close to finish the first part, and will be moving onto the part where we talk more in detail about the initiation rituals and initiation mysteries of the pagan lore. I just have to get through the episodes on berserksgangr, spirits and the summoning of spirits, and the theme of fylgjur and v√¶ttir and other m√°ttugar ‚Äì powers. First. These will begin to appear in January 2022. Then we will move onto the initiation stories. I have published about one or two lengthy lectures every month for the last ten months, so we are getting closer to twenty videos by now. All these videos are out on my Patreon. So far, they either are, or else they form smaller parts of - greater episodes with the themes of  basic information about 1.  What Fj«´lkyngi was , 2.  Oracular divination sei√∞r, 3.  The priestesses ‚Äì the v«´lur who named children, 4. Practical sei√∞r for the purposes of  summoning the game , for  healing , influencing the  weather , f inding lost or hidden things  and so on - and people, including many stories of summoning powers, shape-shifting, out-of-body travel, things that are also well presented in episode 5 5. Harmful sei√∞r and saga-zombies; so called black magic:  The N√≠dst√∂ng ,  Burial Customs ,  Necromancy , and  Waking the Dead 6. The sixth episode, which I just recently finished, dealt with  priestesses of war and human sacrifice ,  sei√∞r-men as mentors to kings, princes and warlords , and t he story of the conversion process in northern Europe , when many men who practiced sei√∞r were among the  fiercest opponents to the new religion in the religious battles  that followed. So; over to the book project: First of all, the lecture manuscript, as it is, is like a first or second draft. You, my dear patrons, are the reason I have gotten this far this fast. THANKYOU. If I am a bit slow on the next episode, please bear with me. I am going to have to spend some time going through this manuscript to make it into a book manuscript and not a lecture manuscript, and the book will also be even more extensive than the lecture series, as I discovered things on the way. There may also be a change in the order of things, and I have thought to change the title into ‚ÄúGreat Knowledge ‚Äì Stories of Sei√∞r and Fj«´lkyngi. Or, I am not sure, actually. You may suggest better titles if you are familiar with the content by now. The reason for this title, Great Knowledge, is because it is a direct translation of the term by which Norse-speaking pagans back in the Viking Age knew things that we might refer to as anything from shamanism to witchcraft and sorcery to oracular divination to poetry to spiritual mysteries and any form of sublime wisdom and knowledge: Fj«´lkyngi. Fj«´lkyngi ‚Äì I am sure this word is not something that most people internationally are familiar with. In translations of saga literature, we usually only see words like sorcery or witchcraft where the word Fj«´lkyngi was applied in the original source. But the word actually directly translates as ‚ÄúGreat Knowledge‚Äù. This Great Knowledge, Fj«´lkyngi, is an umbrella term which covers all sorts of pagan, esoteric arts; skaldsk√°p, as in poetry, sei√∞r, as in witchcraft and divination, galdrar, as in spell-songs, berserksgangr, as in battle ecstasy, out-of-body travel, summoning the spirits, changing shape, runes, healing and so on. Often reduced to a simple word; magic, in some way or other. OTHER CREATIONS AND COMING PROJECTS ON PATREON: 1. I will continue the Fj«´lkyngi series, ending the first part hopefully  before february 2022. 2. This work will form the draft of a new BOOK manuscript: GREAT KNOWLEDGE (working title) to be published in 2022-2023 3. The second part will begin in february/march 2022 and will be about INITIATIONS. 4. AUDIO mp3 files of my video lectures 5. Audio books (if I have time) Adding to this, I have also produced some other lectures and stuff that is out on Patreon: About various seasonal celebrations, About burial mounds in Vestfold  and other archaeological sites and cultural walks. AUDIO BOOK READINGS:  I have been trying to record chapter by chapter from my first novel,  The Hammer of Greatness , what has been a bit much amidst all the other things, and which was also surprisingly hard to put voice to. The voice of the book itself sounds, inside my head, like the voices of the people who tell the story, but when read out loud, it becomes different. It also contains some painful moments that were harder to say out loud than it was to write them. But I am, slowly, little by little, getting through the book ‚Äì each episode already recorded is also out on my Patreon. Wish you a happy Yule and Winter Solstice PREVIOUS INTRODUCTION (2020-21) Biography Maria Kvilhaug\n(Oslo, Norway 1975-) is the author of¬† The Seed of Yggdrasill ,¬† The Maiden With The Mead   and the¬† Blade Honer ¬†series, as well as other books,¬†articles and lecture videos.

Are you among those who want to see those promised publications about Seidr, about Idunn, and about Initiation Stories, and so on? Would you have liked me to have more livestream lectures? Would you like to see recordings of live lectures/livestream lectures? Do you just like my work in general, such as my¬† website/blog , my¬† Facebook page , and want to see more articles published there?¬† If so, you might want to help me out by sponsoring my Patreon page so that I might get the time and energy I need to offer up all that - in great abundance! Why Patreon? For more than twelve years, I have been publishing articles, videos, and livestream lectures, and tried my best to reply to questions, and all of this is really  hard  work requiring a  lot of time and energy  - making an hour long lecture/video can take weeks of preparation! I have happily done all this work without asking anything in return from my readers and listeners, hoping that booksales would support my living. Well.  For the last few years, booksales have supported about 5% to 20% of my minimum necessity monthly income -¬† and this in a world where you simply need money to pay your bills and live a normal life - in my case in such an expensive country as Norway is.¬†This means that, after a blissfull era of extreme creative energy, I burned out from the fact that I still had to aquire 95% - 80 % of my income by working hard labor as a healthcare worker. Anyone who works in healthcare knows how much that can dry up your extra resources.  So this is the simple math: The more patrons I can get to sponsor me by monthly payment, the more can I free up time and energy to create more videos, write more articles, make audio recordings of my books, and finish my book projects!  And if you do sponsor me, you are the ones who will be seeing my latest videos!¬† Sadly, the time of just giving away all that hard work for free is over.¬† I would have loved to make more videos and lectures free of charge, but I cannot afford it, and then they will not be made at all. It will also take a lot longer for more books to be finished, and fewer articles and research papers.¬†¬† If you do sponsor me, you will get access to new videos of various themes and lengths, podcasts, lectures and heads up about new stuff! The more people sponsor me (and the more each are willing to pay), the more videos I pledge to make, including livestream lectures and audio recordings of my books - they will all be made available for those who are willing to help me out here, and you will be the first to be informed about new stuff that may come out.  I have not made special treatment for those who pay me more - I am sorry, but I really want to be accessible to anyone and I know what it is like to have few resources.

For Those Who Know Me Already: Have you been missing more videos from the  Lady of the Labyrinth YouTube page ?  Are you among those who have asked me to make more  lecture videos , as I did so much back in 2009-2014? Or more  art-based mythology videos ?  Are you among those eagerly waiting for the next  Blade Honer  book? Are you among those who wish me to  publish my books in audio or video ? Are you among those who want to see those promised publications about Seidr, about Idunn, and about Initiation Stories, and so on? Would you have liked me to have more livestream lectures? Would you like to see recordings of live lectures/livestream lectures? Do you just like my work in general, such as my  website/blog , my  Facebook page , and want to see more articles published there?  If so, you might want to help me out by sponsoring my Patreon page so that I might get the time and energy I need to offer up all that - in great abundance! Why Patreon? For more than twelve years, I have been publishing articles, videos, and livestream lectures, and tried my best to reply to questions, and all of this is really  hard  work requiring a  lot of time and energy  - making an hour long lecture/video can take weeks of preparation! I have happily done all this work without asking anything in return from my readers and listeners, hoping that booksales would support my living. Well. For the last few years, booksales have supported about 5% to 20% of my minimum necessity monthly income -  and this in a world where you simply need money to pay your bills and live a normal life - in my case in such an expensive country as Norway is. This means that, after a blissfull era of extreme creative energy, I burned out from the fact that I still had to aquire 95% - 80 % of my income by working hard labor as a healthcare worker. Anyone who works in healthcare knows how much that can dry up your extra resources. So this is the simple math: The more patrons I can get to sponsor me by monthly payment, the more can I free up time and energy to create more videos, write more articles, make audio recordings of my books, and finish my book projects! And if you do sponsor me, you are the ones who will be seeing my latest videos!  Sadly, the time of just giving away all that hard work for free is over.  I would have loved to make more videos and lectures free of charge, but I cannot afford it, and then they will not be made at all. It will also take a lot longer for more books to be finished, and fewer articles and research papers.  If you do sponsor me, you will get access to new videos of various themes and lengths, podcasts, lectures and heads up about new stuff! The more people sponsor me (and the more each are willing to pay), the more videos I pledge to make, including livestream lectures and audio recordings of my books - they will all be made available for those who are willing to help me out here, and you will be the first to be informed about new stuff that may come out. I have not made special treatment for those who pay me more - I am sorry, but I really want to be accessible to anyone and I know what it is like to have few resources. However, if you can afford it, be aware that the more income I can get from this, the more will you get back also. I will simply get more time for this work.  What will I offer my patrons? ‚Äò I will use Patreon to offer up special treats to those among my readers and listeners who are willing to sponsor me. My offering in return will be talks and presentations in the form of videos, perhaps podcasting and even livestream lectures - to donating patrons only. Recordings of livestream lectures will be made available to patrons. The more patrons I get, and the higher their donations, the more time will I be able to spend time making great stuff for my readers and listeners ‚Äì and to write more books too (even the free stuff). I will not offer extra stuff to higher payers - but those who can and wish to sponsor me more than the minimum may dwell in the bliss of knowing that you are helping me make a living out of this and be able to produce more books and talks.

This Patreon Page was opened on the Winter Solstice of 2020. This tier is for people who are willing to support my work with more than the minimum. As a bonus, more- and a lot-paying patrons will get PDFs with transcripts/manuscripts of lectures on the way. I would have liked to offer a lot of extra stuff for more-paying patrons, but in order to provide live lectures and many other things, I would have to be able to live from this work full time. So this tier is for those who want the written lectures, or who just want to be extra supportive of my work. Thankyou :) BIOGRAPHY AND LISTS OF VIDEOS ON PATREON AND OTHER LINKS: Maria Kvilhaug (Oslo, Norway 1975-) is the author of  The Seed of Yggdrasill ,  Blade Honer  series, as well as other books, articles and lecture videos. Most of her works stem from her academic background in the historical, cultural, linguistic and religious aspects of pre-Christian Scandinavia. From ca 2008-2016, she produced several videos on  LadyoftheLabyrinth YouTube channel,  but eventually slowed down because it became too much time-consuming and hard, unpaid work. She continued writing books and articles, though, As of December, 2020, Maria began to post lecture videos for patrons. The economic support has and will encourage and finance more productions; videos, lectures, articles, books. The more support, the more time is freed to work on all of these things. So far, the support has helped birth a series of storytelling lectures about mythology and cultural history, with special focus on Sei√∞r.

I‚Äôve¬†been drawing ever since i could hold a pencil and got heavily into drawing anime/manga back in middle school!¬†Art has always been a huge part of who i am as a person and i've always strived to make the most of my little hobby. Now im 27 years old and working towards creating art as a full time occupation, and have decided on trying a Patreon to make that process a bit easier for myself ‚ô• If you wish to support me and stick with me through this journey of mine I would be forever grateful! Any kind of support is always appreciated ‚ô• My content here will mainly consist of fanart and fanmerch from My Hero Academia, as that is my biggest inspiration and fandom right now! My favorite characters are Bakugou and Kirishima, so you will be seeing a lot of them here haha Im pretty new to drawing fanart and making merchandise of my own, but it is something that brings me a lot of joy and hope to be able to share that with you all through the different tier options i have available! There will be opportunities to even vote and help decide on what future store merch and patreon-exclusive merch i do ^^ FAQ 1. When will i be charged? Patrons are charged up front when they pledge. This means that you will be charged the day you become a patron, giving you access to all content shared within your reward tier for the current month! Payments will then reoccur every first of the month after the initial charge 2. When are rewards distributed? after payments are processed for the month; discount codes are posted in the beginning of the month, physical rewards are mailed out when the month is over, and digital rewards are posted throughout the month! 3. Will you have patreon merch in your store later?/How can i get merch rewards from previous months? All merch made for patreon are patreon exclusive! There is a new set of pins every month, meaning that in order to receive a certain pin you must pledge within that pin's month. (Ex: pledge in august to receive august's pin, etc) I have no intention on selling patreon merch in my store aside from in mystery bags, but i will be setting up a patreon-exclusive store for patrons to purchase previous merch rewards at a later date üòä 4. Can i change/cancel/upgrade my pledge? you can always change, upgrade, or cancel your pledge at any time!¬†Since you pay up front when you pledge: - If you increase your pledge, you'll be charged the difference between your current tier amount, and your new tier amount, giving you access to the new tier's content instantly. ¬†- When you cancel or downgrade your pledge, it will be reflected in the following month, not the current month. 5. How do you grade your pins? I am not a strict pin grader as pins are handmade and none are perfect. The pin you receive for each month will be either an A or B-grade pin, which i consider standard. These pins may have one or two minor flaws such as small spots or specks, light scratches, etc, but these flaws will not take away from the overall look of the pin! In general I do try to ensure that you are getting the best of the batch!¬†", "amount_post": 294, "amount_subs": 223, "price_tiers": [{"title": "Tip Jar", "monthly": "$3", "description": "a tier for lovely people who would like to show their support! every bit is appreciated! ‚ô• \n \n includes: \n‚Ä¢ access to patron-only posts/feed \n‚Ä¢ view sketches, wips, full res art, and livestreams ‚Ä¢ store discount codes ‚Ä¢ patreon secret shop access ‚Ä¢ vote in polls \n‚Ä¢ my deepest thanks and gratitude ‚ô•"}, {"title": "Small Pin Tier", "monthly": "$20", "description": "This tier is for US patrons ‚Ä¢ one small pin (1.5 - 2 inches) ‚Ä¢ matching sticker ‚Ä¢ pins wil be mixed grade (A/B grade) ‚Ä¢ all perks from tip jar"}, {"title": "Large Pin Tier", "monthly": "$30", "description": "This tier is for US patrons ‚Ä¢ one large pin (2.5 - 3 inches) ‚Ä¢ matching sticker ‚Ä¢ pins will be mixed grade (A/B grade) ‚Ä¢ all perks from tip jar"}], "tags": "", "socialmedias": ["https://www.instagram.com/bakaqeyama"]},

Thank you for taking a look at my Patreon Page. I started Paola's Pixels in 2017 because I noticed a real lack of color in the Tabletop RPG designs being sold online. Since then, I've created and sold enamel pins, t-shirts, skirts, patches and so much more. I still have a lot of designs that I want to share so I decided to open a Patreon to be able to offer limited edition designs that will be available first for my Patreons and then added in limited amounts to my store. I've decided to open my Patreon as a Sticker Club first and add the Pin Club as a goal that will hopefully be reached soon :) How does this work? This Patreon charges by creation, which means there might not be new rewards every month. I will announce the designs when they're ready and you have until a deadline I give in the announcement post to sign up. On the deadline date I will post the Paid Post and anyone who has pledged on a reward tier will receive their rewards at the beginning of the next month. Patreon will charge your account the 1st of the month even if the paid post is done in the middle of the month. I will be shipping your rewards at the beginning of the month after a paid post. For example:  May 10th: I'll announce the new rewards and give a deadline to sign up of May 20th May 30th: Last day to sign up for the rewards, paid post goes up June 1st: Patreon charges your account June 7th: June rewards are sent Is shipping included? Yes, but the shipping for stickers and international tier doesn't come with tracking. US enamel pin shipping does have tracking. Will Patrons get to vote on the designs? Yes, I will be taking any Patron suggestions and making polls when it's time for me to design new stickers Are the designs exclusive to Patreon? No, a limited amount will be available in my store after the Patron rewards have been shipped but Patrons will have a discounted price here always. What's the sticker material? The single stickers are printed on glossy vinyl sticker paper that is waterproof. The sticker sheets are matte. What will the Patreon exclusive content be? I will post process videos of how I work on my designs, how I vector my images and how I make patterns. I will share wallpapers every month. Why does this Patreon charge by creation? Because I can't keep up with designing new content every month. This way I can charge only when I have new designs for you!", "amount_post": 80, "amount_subs": 219, "price_tiers": [{"title": "Inspiration", "monthly": "$10", "description": "The tip jar tier includes: \n \n \n Access to polls to decide new designs \n Access to process videos and tutorials Phone wallpapers Access to private Discord channel \n My never-ending gratitude \n"}, {"title": "Magical Item", "monthly": "$10", "description": "This tier includes: \n \n One 2.5\" vinyl sticker \n Access to polls to decide new designs \n Access to process videos and tutorials Phone wallpapers Access to private Discord channel \n"}, {"title": "Treasure Chest", "monthly": "$10", "description": "This tier includes: \n \n \n One 4\" x 6\" sticker sheet \n One 2.5\" vinyl sticker \n Access to polls to decide new designs \n Access to process videos and tutorials Phone wallpapers Access to private Discord channel \n"}], "tags": "", "socialmedias": ["https://www.instagram.com/paolaspixels", "https://twitter.com/Irrel", "https://youtube.com/channel/UC1VwKxbFkA5x83qYmEnnuzA", "https://twitch.tv/irrel22"]},

I'm a Cheshire-based cartoonist, and while I've previously worked as a storyboard artist for over three years I am taking the plunge to try and make my own work my main source of income, woo!  If you'd like to see some examples, please head over to my main website¬† JolleyComics.com  - there are lots of fun things to click on, amongst which there are animations, short illustrated stories, written works and individual art pieces but to name a few! One of the larger incentives to start up this patreon is that, due to health reasons, I have been told that I cannot both draw for a professional living and do my own work outside of it. I would very probably shrivel up and die without being able to draw and write my own work, and consequntly the logical step is to endeavour to make my own work my professional living! There is also a rather real possibility that I will not be able to draw for the rest of my life, as the joints in my fingers are affected by the condition and will likely get worse as I age, so the sooner I can focus all my energy on completing my stories the more likely I will be able to before it gets to that point. I've been very lucky with the people who have helped and supported \nme thus far, and I can't imagine how I could have done as much as I have\n without my family and friends. This is the next chapter, and while it \nis a frighteningly big step it would be churlish to put aside what they \nhave already given me without at least trying to make a go of it. If I am able to reach minimum wage with Patreon, I will be able to commit 100% of my time to working on the stories you guys want to read! I will also be able to do more exercise to prevent my body from falling to pieces, and I will be able to plan research trips to make the art I create that much more accurate and pretty! I will also be able to structure my time more efficiently, so that when I'm taking a break from the comic I can write something instead, or put aside a few hours to do a livestream of my drawing process! I will also be providing step by steps of how I make some of my work, and if you support me you can always put in a request of what kind of pictures you would like to see a 'guide to' version of. Who knows! If all goes well I may be able to start visiting conventions in other countries, to visit you and give you access to physical copies of the work that you'll be helping me to make!

Curate LA solves this problem with the threefold aim of promoting emerging artists, helping everyone experience more art, and fostering growth in the various communities that make up the city‚Äôs creative network of art urbs. We highlight a number of different types of art-related events by galleries, museums and artist-run spaces, focusing on a variety of different types of art. We give studio visits to artists and build bridges between them as well as the institutions, galleries and art collectors based in the city, giving everyone a better perspective of the art scene in Los Angeles County. Our platform is essential¬†for artists, curators, art writers, art advisors, designers, architects, journalists, gallery owners, interior decorators, museum directors and other key community members.

You probably know me for drawing the usual suggestive or NSFW artworks of different video games and anime women.  I have decided to take this work to a new level, as such, it is of the utmost importance for you to help a fellow cultured individual flourish in this endeavor. Let's queue the presentation paragraph, without putting you to sleep.  I am just someone who has grown up around video games, anime and technology, with a somewhat early interest for drawing.  It was a few years ago that I transitionned into the world of digital art to expand what I could create. My art is a mix of my love for the painterly and the anime aesthetics, a weird crossover I got interested in a long time ago, and the process has since stuck with me. From that point, I've been self-taught and am still learning about a lot of stuff, so if you are interested in seeing me grow throughout this journey, you can hop right in. You can see my work on:  [Twitter]   [Deviantart]   [Hentai-Foundry]  (NSFW obviously) I started this art journey for fun, but I decided to launch this patreon in the hopes that I could earn a little extra on the side and keep this thing going, as my time available is very limited and I pretty much don't earn anything from drawing these artworks.

You can find tutorials on just about any technical aspect of music making but how do you channel creativity, how do you make creative decisions that  make your music and¬† performances better ? This is where mentoring comes in. Based on your personal situation, I can help you figure out how to find your own voice, your own sound, and how to turn rough ideas to songs, EP‚Äôs, albums, even live sets..

The program has  three  tiers, with different intensities. The  Group Sessions  are at the core of the program ; Every month I discuss a different subject in a Zoom session with your group, provide resources and ideas, and I‚Äôm available by DM or email for feedback and questions. Besides that the groups extensively use a  Slack Channel  to exchange demos and work in progress. For people who are looking for individual guidance, I do  one-on-one sessions  (the Individual Tier, also includes access to Group). There‚Äôs limited availability for those, so if you are interested drop me an email first. In the last week of every month I also host a  Q&A Zoom session with special guests . This is the Deeper Dive Tier. In this Tier you also have access to older Q&A‚Äôs and archives of ones you missed. I was interviewed recently on the  Holding Hands Podcast with Guava and Desert Sound Colony¬† about the program and it's quite a good explainer of what I do: ¬† https://soundcloud.com/holdinghandsrecords/holding...

Several years ago, my life was changed forever when I experienced fire dancing for the first time at Burning Man. I endeavored to learn the art and channeled my heart and soul into it. To give myself a regular goal to shoot for, I started uploading weekly videos to my YouTube channel showcasing what I'd learned every week. These videos quickly took on a life of their own and I got unprecedented opportunities to travel, teach, and perform. I've grown from a hobbyist to an educator in this art that I love and have spent a huge portion of the past seven years spreading that love around the globe. What are the Flow Arts? The Flow Arts are a collection of movement arts that include elements of circus, dance, martial arts, sports, and meditation to create a unique and rapidly growing artform. Usually, this consists of learning how to manipulate one more more props such as Maori poi, hula hoops, staves, juggling clubs, or many more in an aesthetically pleasing way. Practicing this art frequently has meditative benefits for participants and for many the goal of this practice is to attain a state of \"flow\" in which movement becomes effortless and unconsciously guided. Even if flow isn't your goal, however, spinning props is great fun and a wonderful form of exercise! What is my Goal? The Flow Arts is an amazing community for self-empowerment and fulfillment, but our resources haven't kept pace with our meteoric growth in the past few years. We have a wonderfully diverse and passionate group of people to draw on, but frequently the resources they have to draw upon are scattered and incomplete. Over the past 7 years I've learned a lot about educating people on how to spin their props but that only scratches the surface of what we need as flow artists to realize our goals. I want to take knowledge that has been accrued within the community and make it more broadly available to the wider world. I have viewers in countries and places that I'll never be able to visit myself. I'd like to give them the tools that they need to be able to select which tools they want to spin, meet other individuals that share their passion, how to spin safely, learn to dance with their prop, and many many other topics. I want my channel to become an online knowledge base for the Flow Arts world. A place where people come to in order to get the answer to common questions.

Consider becoming a patron somewhere during the beginning of the month if you don't want to be charged twice! Introduction Hey there, I'm a 3D artist and animator that utilizes Blender to produce animated erotic content involving cute girls from video games and media. My work specializes in POV (but not exclusively) and very intimate experiences, sometimes exploring more diverse routes but still carrying that essence. Patreon and You My content will always be free for everyone to watch, however your support nets you a few humble bonuses as well as helps me produce more animations. There are a few optional tiers for those looking to show further support! As of 2022 I'm now providing VR animations in 6K/4K 60fps as well as standard videos in 4K 60fps, with older content being remastered and re-rendered to meet these new standards over time.  My VR videos are available in 5800x2900 (6K) to 4000x2000 (4K) 60fps in native quality, no image or framerate upscaling.  :) Come on in if you've got a headset to try out and let me know what you think! Where Your Support Goes Hardware & Electricity  - Rendering uses a lot of power, so aside from covering the electricity costs it also helps me set up hardware to produce renders in higher resolutions much faster. Not to mention motion capture, 3d tools, etc. Voice Acting  - I can produce content with more elaborate voice audio thanks to the ability to support a talented voice cast! Longer/Ambitious Animations  - It takes a lot of time out of my day to produce animated content, and plugging other needs will help me look into longer projects and voice talent to fit them! It also lets me invest into tech that can streamline some of this process. Q&A When do you release animations? ¬† For short loops I usually try to aim within a month unless complications arise, longer projects vary due to tuning, render times, sound, etc. Admittedly my workflow isn't very fast and I often miss my own personal deadlines, but I spend a great amount of time polishing to ensure everything is good as can be. How do you decide what character you're going to use? ¬† I like to animate ideas that come to my head but I also listen to a lot of supporter feedback! Do you take commissions? ¬† Not as of writing but keep an eye out! I have a cool animation idea, can I share it? ¬†  Drop by my Twitter DMs or my Discord server, I can never guarantee I'll ever do them but I'm always willing to hear out ideas! Do you release the models you use? ¬† For personal reasons usually it's a no. Please don't ask for them unless I choose to release them. ¬† ", "amount_post": 179, "amount_subs": 1, "price_tiers": [{"title": "Tip", "monthly": "$2", "description": "\n Vote on occasional Patreon-exclusive animation polls \n Themed thank you postcard featuring characters in the respective animation, usually comedy or pinup \n"}, {"title": "Supporter", "monthly": "$3", "description": "Access to Patreon feed Watermark-free 1080p, 4K, and VR 6K/4K 60fps Animations Vote on occasional Patreon-exclusive animation polls Bonus images for each animation release, typically pinup and extras Discord role that allows access to patron-exclusive discussion & project planning channels, as well as a cool orange name color to rep your support"}, {"title": "Supporter +", "monthly": "$5", "description": "\n Includes all previous rewards \n \n For those that want to give a little extra - thank you! :)¬†"}], "tags": "", "socialmedias": ["https://twitter.com/nodusfm"]},

We do all kinds interesting/unique takes on decks and have many ways to be fun and entertaining. In CCONation, all are welcome. On CCOPodcast, you'll hear us talk about building spicy Commander brews, how to spice up boring lists and drinking beer.

Or be able to pronounce it! Collectively, we have somewhere around 46 years of Magic the Gathering playing experience! Now, we play commander exclusively.¬†That is, if¬†you don't count the MtG drinking games we make up along the way. We started CCOPodcast for a few reasons. First and foremost, because we both love Magic the Gathering. It's become part of who we are and created some of the strongest bonds¬†that people can have in their lives. Second, Brando works in radio and while he isn't currently a radio personality, that's one of his career goals. The podcast acts as an avenue towards that goal. It certainly didn't hurt to have a radio station's recording equipment at our disposal! Our Community Astoundingly to us, we now have, what we call, a world wide Audience! As mentioned before, that audience has come to be known and¬† #CCONation . The majority of our listenership resides in the USA and Canada but¬† the top 10 countries in  #CCONation  after that are Brazil, The United Kingdon, Australia, Philippines, Germany, Belgium, Italy, The Netherlands, Mexico and¬†France!¬†Holy crap, that's awesome!

Dudes that you might want to actually hang out with, chill drink some beer and jam games! We do Arcs of episodes. Like mini-seasons. A few episodes in a row on a common topic to get as much coverage as we can. Along with each new Arc comes a giveaway! You can enter for free too! Tune in to find out how.

I have a podcast where I chat with remarkable artists from around the world.\n \n \nIf you haven‚Äôt heard of my podcast before, here are previous episodes to give you an idea of what the it‚Äôs like. \n \n http://www.johndalton.me/podcasts/   (but don‚Äôt rush off just yet.) \n \nHere is artwork from some of the artists I‚Äôve chatted with so far on the podcast.\n \n \nBo Bartlett\n \n \nTeresa Oaxaca\n \n \nVincent Desiderio\n \n \nDorian Vallejo\n \n \nRon English\n \n \n \nPretty fantastic right, and that's just a few.\n \n \nHere is what people have been saying about the podcast.\n \n \n ‚ÄúI would just like to add that I think John Dalton is the new Vasari of the New Renaissance!‚Äù  \n‚ÄúOne of the best ART broadcasts I've ever listened to.‚Äù \n \n\"Quite an enchanting interview that spoke volumes about both interviewer \nand interviewee‚Ä¶  thank you so much for a wonderful hour and a half!\"\n \n\"Wonderful interview!  Thanks John for all the podcasts.\"\n \n\"John‚Äôs questions were thoughtful, well pointed and interesting.\nReally enjoyed this conversation! Thanks.\"\n \n\"Excellent, charming and educative interview.\"\n \n \nPretty humbling.\n \n \nThese are long form in-depth conversations.\n \nIt takes me about a day and a half of research in preparation for each podcast. \n \nThe recording takes about another half a day.\n \nAnd then it takes me about a another 2 days to edit the podcast.\n \nSometimes that can blow out to be more . . . like with Vincent Desiderio which took me about five days of research in preparation because Vincent has given so many lectures and interviews\n \nOr the podcast with Candice Bohannon and Julio Reyes which ended up being 3hours long and took about 5 days to edit.\n \nSo there‚Äôs a lot of work involved and the Inbetweenisodes take even longer. \n \n Where does Patreon fit in? \nPatreon is a good old fashioned subscription service made new. It comes under the umbrella of ‚Äòcrowdfunding,‚Äô but is different from other crowdfunding websites like, Kickstarter and Indiegogo in that with Patreon you commit to a small amount of money regularly - every month. As I said, like a subscription. Patreon was founded by artists themselves which is why I think they, ‚Äúget it.‚Äù A little bit of regular money is, in many ways, better than a big lump of money out of the blue.\n \n \n How much? \nFor as little as the price of a cup of tea every a month you can support the podcast. You can pledge more if you like and you can stop whenever you like.  You can road test how it works if you're scared (you can pull out before you're charged at the end of any month, so it's risk-free.)  \n \n", "amount_post": 281, "amount_subs": 200, "price_tiers": [{"title": "$5 Cup of Tea Level", "monthly": "$5", "description": "If you met me in real life would you like to have a cup of tea with me? \n \n Well now you can - the tea ¬†part at least.

Because art history, like everything, is all about the story. I started¬† The Lonely Palette   with the goal of telling these stories , one painting, sculpture, exhibition, and urinal at a time.¬†  Using the object as a jumping-off point, we've dived together into the significance, history, and social context of artists and movements, and they've been, I hope, as neat, accessible, and compelling to you as they are to me. ¬† Think of the adventures we've had together!¬† Remember when we made  abstraction a little less terrifying ?¬† And  Degas' Aunt Fanny a little less boring ?¬† Remember when we  compared Monet canvases to Lay's potato chips , and explained exactly  why Nazi art was so sucky ?¬† We've dived headfirst into¬† art history's woman problem , and¬† cavorted with Futurist douchebags .¬† And all without leaving the comfort of your earbuds! Here's the thing, though.¬†  The lonely\npart is no joke : ¬† The Lonely Palette  is\njust me.¬† I research, write,\nproduce, host, and edit the whole shebang, and believe me when I tell you that\nit‚Äôs the best part of my week.¬† But even\na labor of love is labor, and ask Van Gogh how only selling one painting in his\nlifetime worked out for him. This is where you come in! ¬† You can bring  The Lonely Palette  to the masses, one patron at a time.¬† And donating\neven just a few dollars an episode\nmeans that I can...  Upgrade my recording gear... Pay for vocal booths... ...and, most\nimportantly, take the show on the road to museums across the country\nand around the world, sending you postcards all along the way. ¬† FAQ: ¬† I'm new to Patreon.¬† So I just give once and get my mug, right? Nope!¬† You're a full-blown patron of the arts, like a modern day Lorenzo di Medici, supporting Michelangelo on a continual basis in exchange for art, except this is even better than a marble tomb, because you get swag, too!¬† In short,  you pay this amount every time I release an episode , which I hope you believe to be a worthy cause. Whoa whoa whoa.¬† How often do you release an episode? My goal is to release 12 episodes (ideally) per year, 10 at a minimum.¬† I don't charge patrons for re-releases or special episodes (live recordings, etc.), only when I put pen to paper and mic to face.¬† So it's equivalent-ish to  monthly support ¬†- for every month I release two episodes, you'll find me on my fainting couch taking a month off.¬† Don't forget, too, that you can set a monthly limit for how much you can give. I want to give, but I'm broke, and a $1 per episode seems lame and/or insulting.  So I just won't do anything.  Bye. No no no!  Come back!  No amount is too little , BELIEVE ME.   Every little bit counts , and is so very much appreciated. I love the show, but I just can't support you anymore, or at the level I signed up at.¬† Am I a monster if I abandon this? No, not at all.¬† This is 100% voluntary.¬† Please just do me a favor before you go: leave a rating/review on iTunes, post about the show on social media, and tell one new person face-to-face.¬†  Word of mouth  is still the best (and only) way to spread the news about podcasts, and it would help me out enormously. *** So go ahead. ¬†Channel your inner Medici. ¬†Consider becoming a patron of  The Lonely Palette . ¬† And ¬† thank you , from the bottom of my heart, for supporting, for listening, and for giving me the opportunity to see art through your eyes so you can look with your ears. - Tamar", "amount_post": 37, "amount_subs": 202, "price_tiers": [{"title": "Postage Stamp", "monthly": "$1", "description": "\n Gratitude as eternal as Mona Lisa's smile. \n Your name entered into a quarterly drawing for a musuem-shop trinket! \n"}, {"title": "Still Life Painting", "monthly": "$2", "description": "\n \n Pay What You Can Museum Absolution.

I graduated from an Ivy League university in the US, and obtained two master degrees, including an MBA. I worked as a Private Wealth Manager for a Wall Street firm and as a Private Banker, where I learned that reality in the financial world is the opposite of theory learned in academic environments. Unfortunately, I also learned that ethics and morality are severely lacking in this industry as well, and my disenchantment with the low utility of my academic career at some of the top institutions in the world combined with my disillusionment with the corporate finance industry launched my entrepreneurial career. I‚Äôm excited to tell you more about the skwealthacademy community that is helping me move forward in my vision of revolutionizing the education system to make critical thinking skills and application of knowledge in the real world, two aspects astonishingly absent in most traditional forums of schooling today, the backbone of any educational institution that wants to attract intellectually curious students. As someone that achieved national university entrance exam scores in the top 1% of the nation and that graduated from an ivy league university, I often incorrectly correlated these academic achievements to intelligence due to the naivete of youth. \n \nHowever, the more I researched the history of academics, the more I learned about the focus of academics on tasks that have low correlation to intellectual development, \n such as rote memorization of facts and the administration of an exam based system   that often tests for low intellectual abilities like superficial problem solving and the regurgitation of information without any demonstrated ability to understand complex concepts and the applicability of these concepts to improve one‚Äôs quality of life in the real world. In other words, most exam systems administered in classrooms all over the world fuel competition among students for high-grades, that even if achieved, predominantly fail to develop intellect and real-world skills. \n \nFor this reason, while attending the University of Pennsylvania, I often met students at fellow Ivy League schools that possessed near perfect GPAs but demonstrated a near complete absence of critical thinking skills, while I often met students with far lower GPAs that exhibited far greater intellect. Because our global academic system lauds students as brilliant without imparting any deep critical thinking skills to them, my mission at skwealthacademy is to correct this massive failure of the system, and one that I intend to correct. I have already completed writing materials for all 19 courses and nearly 80 accompanying exercises, appropriate for everyone between the ages of 6 and 106, and I am now in the process of proofing all materials and recording all materials in audio/visual format. After I launch skwealthacademy, it is my wish to provide some truly exciting additional opportunities for skwealthacademy members all around the world to connect with one another all and to perhaps even use these new networks to launch their own entrepreneurial pursuits, so stay tuned! \n \nTogether, let‚Äôs return the focus of academics on the development of critical thinking skills that translate to the real world and steer it away from the pursuit of meaningless high grades. In doing so, we will instill in our communities the indelible values of cooperation, camaraderie and goodwill among all of humanity.\n \nI look forward to staying connected and have a blessed day!\n \nBlessings,\n \nJohn Kim CEO &\nFounder  skwealthacademy \n", "amount_post": 365, "amount_subs": 199, "price_tiers": [{"title": "the blessed", "monthly": "$10", "description": "For the blessed generous souls that have asked how they can show thanks and donate a small monthly stipend for the 16+ years I've been producing free content online and educating the masses about financial and investment truths.

Membership to patreon does not give you membership to the skwealthacademy substack platform. These are two distinct platforms.  This tier provides access to 2 patron audio only podcasts every month, released on the 1st to 3rd of each month, as well as access to 3-5 short three to seven minute videos every week, released on the patreon platform, in which I discuss gold, silver, sound money v. cryptocurrency issues, and occasional various other finance and money topics. The normal format of these weekly videos is addressing financial topics M-F, and if I upload any videos on Sat, Sun, I speak about other issues like critical thinking, maintaining physical and mental health, and so on. The two podcasts will always address two topics (1) wealth building and investment tips; and (2) larger life issues, purpose and how to build a meaningful life and sustainable happiness. On occasion, I discuss options strategies on specific stocks, including buying put and call options. Most options strategies are reserved for the Benefactor and higher level membership. IMPORTANT: Only experienced options traders should consider the options strategies  I discuss, as no one should trade options before they understand exactly the risks, and how to properly manage the risks and secure rewards when trading options.I often release critical information in the daily lens\nvideos to which you have access, that disappear after 24 hours, so please try\nto view them all, as they tend to be only 5 to 8 minutes in length.I will be creating all videos on the lens app, which posts\nvideos that disappear after 24 hours. for more info on how to view these\nvideos, please click this link  https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005662363--How-do-I-view-my-creators-Lens-stories-  Lastly, only transcendent level patrons receive occasional bonus articles about investing topics that you may see labelled on my blog as \"password protected, patrons only\".¬† Benefactor level members will always receive access to ALL bonus written articles.  These articles are the most valuable of all articles I post on my news site and available only to transcendent and higher level patrons .  Please note ALL PASSWORDS can be found in the post to the Patreon platform, so if you merely access content from the Patreon platform, you will find all passwords for password protected articles here.   Transcendent patrons receive passwords to unlock all these articles, some of which contain specific investment tips that have been very profitable in the past. Please listen to the \"Welcome New Patrons\" audio podcast dated 30/31 May 2020 as most new patrons questions are answered there. In addition, please note that this platform is not intended to provide any in-depth analysis of individual stocks, even those that I discuss in investment tips, as I don't have the resources to provide such analysis other than at a price point well above $100 a month. Finally, for all bitcoin enthusiasts, note that all the top-shelf bitcoin price predictions and analysis is available only at the benefactor level membership. I highly recommend that all NEW members read, listen to and consume ALL member postings on this platform for the last two months prior to their joining date at a MINIMUM. Many members ignore this recommendation and only consume information from the date they join and forward, but I guarantee that if you ignore this advice, you will NOT extract maximum benefits (and profits) from your membership.

I may only provide one or two big trading guidances per year. This does not mean that¬† in between these times, when there will be a lot of waiting, that my guidance is not extremely valuable. For example, the last buy/sell guidance, as of April 2022, that I provided here on this platform was to sell BTC at $66k in November 2021 (It reached a high of $69k before crashing quickly by 50%). But in the interim, I've warned multiple times that BTC prices have been stuck in a trading channel and I will provide opinions not to buy, as I recently did at the end of March 2022, when BTC rebounded to nearly $47.5k. Back then I stated that BTC prices were far more likely to fall than to continue higher, after which BTC prices quickly dropped by more than 16%. Furthermore, this membership grants you access to some of the most important musings/ articles about BTC you will ever read, as they are all contrarian thoughts to the echo chamber narratives that appear on all crypto websites. Though there are more BTC related posts in the archives, here is a list of what I feel are the most important podcasts/articles to understand BTC price movements available at the Benefactor level: 19 April 2020: The Biggest Undisclosed Risk in the Global Financial System 22 April 2021: The Most Important BTC Podcast Ever 20 July 2021: The Massive Tether BTC Problem, Intro 3 Aug 2021: The Massive Tether BTC Problem, Part 2 8 Aug 2021: The Crypto/Gold Relationship 6 Sept 2021: TetherUSD Update, my MM Coin Prediction, Crypto Regulation Issues disclaimer: The Content is for informational purposes only, you should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

Before this I was a member of an art website that was also $20 / month, and I've made way better progress here than I did there. Tbh I mostly think that the best knowledge is in the public critique hour, and I think a portion of my $20 / month is just supporting that. I do like the way the apprentice thing give us a bit of accountability though, and is forcing us to do stuff that we wouldn't usually do. Plus it's cool to have a small community here. I think it'd be quite cool to see the apprentice stuff tied in more with the main community a bit more, maybe doing the same challenges (sounds like that might happen next month) because it can feel a bit like this community is totally separate. Basically keep up the good work.\" - Jonathan Hobson \"I've been an apprentice since May 2018, 3 months after I started on my art path , 3 months after I discovered Istebrak and her community. I mention this because it was pivotal for me. My 14 day challenge was what really showed me the power of Istebrak's teachings. I had only picked up a pencil once in a blue moon before, to doodle mostly. I knew art was something I really appreciated and wanted to be able to wield at some point but I never thought it could ever be a calling. Istebrak changed that. I am fully dedicated to becoming the best artist I can be. Ok so that was for context. I approached the apprenticeship cautiously. I knew with that many students, it'd be hard to get more personal feedback, which I craved as a complete beginner. I did learn a lot though, through the Patreon streams and the community. I owe you my very first character concept who has now become one of the protagonists for the story my friend and I are working on and my latest \"masterpiece\" would not have been possible without the apprenticeship. Although I do have to dial my Patreon back down for a little while, I never fail to spread the word about Istebrak and her amazing teachings.

El Mand√≥n and its foremen build walls, borders and fences to try to contain that which they say is a bad example. But they cannot do it, because dignity, courage, anger, rebellion, cannot be stopped or locked up.

I am by no means a maths phd and my videos prove that anyone that is interested can learn this! To date (January 2019) all of my videos combined have earned me a whopping 120 dollars or so in YouTube ad revenue. Obviously, this is not sustainable. Your donations will help me to be more consistent and put out more videos on shader/graphics/game programming, as well as expand into other areas so that everyone can learn to make cool things with code!

Thank you for visiting. Patreon: What & Why? Patreon is a membership platform for creators. Patrons allow for my artistic process to be open, emerging, and expansive. I want my creative work to live less in a realm of transaction (set fees, hourly rates, scarcity) and more in transformation (flow, gift, service, adaptation, abundance). For me, too much transaction crowds and hurts just about everything and everyone I see or touch or love. I want to create a different story for  how I love, give, serve, show up, and make art.¬† What is Intrinsic Paths? A creative \"walking artist\" journey focused on deepening and widening personal and collective relationships to one another, to one's inner life, and to the natural world. You Might Become a Patron if you... (A) have been nourished by my creative work and want to see/inspire more (B) want to go deeper and make a more intentional connection (C) would benefit from receiving various video reflections, walking/movement meditations, walking/movement practices, poetry, art pieces, 25% off all art and jewelry in Intrinsic Paths shop, and more (see projects below). (D) want to support events and programming alongside my new book, WALK - Slow Down, Wake Up & Connect at 1-3 Miles per Hour. Welcome Statement: Beloveds of all backgrounds regardless of age, ability, race, class, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, ethnicity, country of origin, political affiliation, and religious tradition are so beyond welcome to become a Patron. All references to walking are inclusive of moving by wheelchair or powered stroller. Your Patronage Supports: Materials, tools, creative strategy/time, content development, movement building partners, fees, food, bus passes, shelter/rent, and ALL that keeps my body healthy and thriving. *** No strings¬† attached. No hard feelings  for starting, re-arranging, and stopping  as a Patron. None. Ever. Freedom, peace, and dignity for all. *** Current Projects: 1. Walking Invitation, Pedestrian Dignity & WALK Book Tour (1)¬† Walking Invitation  includes contemplative, long-distance, and human dignity-themed programming, custom walking routes, and artmaking.¬† Pedestrian Dignity  is a storytelling initiative using video, photo, audio, and experiential documentation (over 80K followers on TikTok!) of built environments that unapologetically centers all who walk, roll and use transit for transportation, health, and the planet. WALK - Slow Down, Wake Up & Connect at 1-3 Miles Per Hour Inclusive Stories & Practices North Atlantic Books WALK book is out now and can be found wherever books are sold. Check out upcoming dates and events alongside the¬† WALK book tour here . 2. Bold Love Revolving content (with humility and imperfection) on issues of class, race, LGBTQIA2S+, religion, politics, cooperative economics, reparations, colonization, money, Earth care, consumerism, and more.¬†Opening our hearts. Waking up. Healing our pain. Going deeper. If you are me... And I am you... What must we do... Who must we be... 3. Artwork Most days I am carrying around a large sketchbook in my backpack. I love simple ink pen work and crave to spend more time in the years ahead creating and gifting ink art pieces. I also love to wander and collect unique earth stones, fallen juniper pieces, and seashells for n ecklaces, altars, and mixed media art pieces. Learn more about my artwork by visiting the¬† Intrinsic Paths shop  and keeping an eye on social media for upcoming art markets in Colorado. All Patrons receive 25% off anything in the shop, always! 4. Engaged Contemplation Guided (virtual and in-person) meditation, walking meditation, and nature/body/breathing-based practice. Honoring many forms, teachers, traditions, and rituals. Always with imperfection, humility, and vulnerability. \"...the Earth will be safe ¬†when we feel safe in ourselves.\" ~ Thich Nhat Hanh 5. Movement Weaving Protected time creating alongside inspiring individuals and grassroots initiatives that tug on my heart and inspire a more loving, connected, and just world.¬†See some of the Movement Weaving organizations supported by Patrons¬† here . *** My Brief Story: In 2010, I spent 242 days walking across the United States and have continued to walk alongside thousands of people for thousands of miles. I'm a passionate \"Walking Artist\", social entrepreneur (co-ops!), and advocate for racial, social, and economic justice. I'm also LGBTQIA+, Creator of¬† Intrinsic Paths  (+ Pedestrian Dignity), and Founder of  Walk2Connect . I am the author of  WALK - Slow Down, Wake Up, & Connect at 1-3 Miles Per Hour  with North Atlantic Books. I also finished my studies at the Living School for Action and Contemplation in 2017 and have committed my life to help people deepen and heal their relationship with one another, the natural world, and themselves. *** #godeeper #loveharder", "amount_post": 195, "amount_subs": 184, "price_tiers": [{"title": "Leaning in", "monthly": "$2", "description": "All workshops, practices, meditations, video reflections, poetry, and online gatherings. \n~ Moving alongside. \n~ Releasing and trusting. \n~ Opening and listening.

My name is  Travis Hanson  and I create graphic novels¬†original artwork, and fantasy prints that stretch the imagination and encourage people to follow their dreams.

Unfortunately, it has been a hobby and I have not been able to focus on more than one page a week. There are bills to be paid and mouths to be fed. Yet I still believe in the dream and even in the tough times, I have always updated and given Bean's story to the world for free, as well as the comic Life of the Party. I want to finish Bean's story and have it be read and loved. I want people to be able to imagine themselves there with Bean in his adventures in full color, just how I first envisioned it. A full color epic story about the transformation of a young boy into someone more than he ever imagined himself to be.   So why am I here on Patreon? . As the campaign grows, I will be able to dedicate more time to finish  \"The Bean\"  books and go back and produce color versions that will\n inspire and delight the readers. I will also continue to offer a daily comic about adventuring in the form of  \"Life of the Party.\"  Your part in this journey, starts \nwith the first step to become involved with Patreon.  You can help make a\n difference in this project with your generous support.  I am committed to telling the stories of inspiration and hope, \nillustrating them with imaginative artwork, and helping people to find \ntheir own happiness and joy through service and imagination.   What and When are the updates? Life of the Party Updates: There will be a Life of the Party update every single day. I am giving this comic away for free. The rewards will begin to match the RPG gaming world- including npc's, new monsters and Maps.¬† The Bean Updates:  With the help of flattener Darne Lang, we will update the color pages from the beginning of Book 1 once a week. ¬†The more money that is contributed, the more pages will be completed. My ultimate goal would be to update Bean's story in Full Color 5 times a week. Bean and Life of the Party will always be free to read online, but to those special people who become patrons, in addition to helping complete this project, will also have special access to special contests (free art) and opportunities to comment, chat and be the first to preview the story pages before everyone else get to see them.

A day without creating makes me feel out of balance.¬† \n\n Around 20 years ago, I joined EPICA and traveled the world and the seven seas. It has been an fantastic journey that I can say is not just a job, it is a lifestyle. EPICA has shaped me and I am beyond grateful for that. I am so looking forward to what the future may hold for EPICA and hopefully all the great things that have yet to come. \n\n Besides EPICA, I started a blog called ' SMOONSTYLE '. At this moment it has over 12 million views! WOW! It was the perfect platform for me to be creative outside of EPICA. I could stay in touch with all of you and give you a glimpse of the 'behind -the- scenes' of my personal life.  \n\n Slowly my creative focus shifted more towards other social media platforms such as Instagram, Youtube. Besides that my career as a portrait photographer started to take off. I created cover songs together with Oliver, with matching videos that you can all find on my¬† Youtube Channel .  I was touring with EPICA, being a mother, running my photography business, the blog and and and‚Ä¶. a lot more ;) Some things that started as a passion have become a profession and in order to approach my art professionally, I could use your help. I have so many creative ideas that I would like to dive into musically and visually. With your help, I will be able to create more and at a much higher level. ¬† It is time for me to explore the world of Patreon. A place where I can create to my hearts desire; that could be cover songs, music videos, anything photography- related, blogging and so much more! I guess the sky is the limit. I would like to see if this is a good fit for you and me. Through Patreon, I will be able to work together with my  favourite musicians, producers, photographers, videographers, graphic designers and other talented artists .  If you want to be the first to hear my music, watch my videos with all the juicy behind the scenes, then you have come the right place! \n\n So what can you expect?  \n\n On Patreon, I will be focusing on  creating music , my  photography  projects and  blogposts You will have access to: Exclusive Content  that you can only find here Music - You will hear it first  (some of it exclusively) \n Videos - You will see it first  (some of it exclusively) Behind the scenes material including bloopers haha! \n Photography - Download hi-res  versions of my photographs and self portraits \n Blogposts   - you will r ead it first.  My blog  www.smoonstyle.com  will remain solely a beauty/fashion blog. \n Hang Outs ; talking, singing, even cooking maybe?¬† Please have a look a the different memberships that I created and see if there is something that you like and come join the family!¬† \nI welcome you with open arms and can‚Äôt wait to get this creative party started here on Patreon.

He who does not really feel himself lost, is lost without remission; that is to say, he never finds himself, never comes up against his own reality.\" ‚Äì Jos√© Ortega Y Gassett ‚ÄúI want to reconnect to my animal life.‚Äù ‚Äì Kesha By virtue of some exact sequence of events you have arrived here, in this place, with me. Even just this part is a gift. Thank you. This is a place of  learning  and  radical togetherness . An invitation to explore the realms of creativity, of medicine and myth, of the technology of grief and the storied land and all its kin. The work herein touches on questions of edges and margins, of ontology, decolonization, and magic; it is informed by my hospice volunteer work, my background in critical pedagogy and by some theory:¬† post-colonial feminism ,¬† material semiotics , and¬† agential naturalism . It is an exploration of what is being asked of me as an artist, and what is being asked of you as someone who cares about art, in a time of overwhelming information, rupture, and stunning lack of wisdom in the dominant culture. Yet all of us ‚Äì especially, it seems, artists ‚Äì are somehow commanded to make sense of the world without even being able to know what \"the world\" is completely, or say anything about it definitively because who knows what the world according to a cnidarian or a woodfern or star mole might be?  Because in fact we don‚Äôt live in the world, the world lives through  us , by making us sense things. Artists deliver the news of what sense has been made, and it in turn asks the viewer to engage in sense-making in response. This is how artists literally help us make sense of the world. This is what I hope to cultivate in this space: a mutually beneficial and wholly unexpected learning environment where we can share the genuine ideas of the shipwrecked, having been unmoored and brokenhearted by the way things are. This vision is grounded neither in hope nor despair, because in the words of¬† Haraway , neither despair nor hope is tuned to the senses. Rather, we must ‚Äústay with the trouble.‚Äù And so this is an inquiry into what might that look like for a white settler woman of great privileges, plural, who also stands at a crossroads of the influences of complex trauma, kyriarchy, patriarchy, capitalism, colonialism, ecocide, catabolic collapse, Whiteness, bullshit norms, false binaries, and on and on, grasping at the threads of magic [the entanglement of meaning and matter] that are available so a story that might make some sense to someone may be woven from my time here.

In that time,¬†Christopher was trapped in grad school, and publishing novels like¬† War of the Encylopaedists , which the  New York Times  called \"captivating,\" and  Deliver Us , a Foreword Indies Book of the Year finalist.¬† And we've been busy the last few years! Amanda published a memoir called   Waiting to Be Heard , hosted   The Scarlet Letter Reports , a series about the public vilification of women, and we jointly wrote and produced¬† The Truth About True Crime , a podcast and  Facebook Watch series .¬†We've also delved deep into criminal justice reform at  www.crimestory.com . We published our first joint book,  The Cardio Tesseract , a collection of love poems, in February, 2020. And we've done some silly things like¬† this short film  for the 48 Hour Film Festival. Most of our creative output is available for FREE, including the project we've poured our hearts and brains into the last few years, our podcast¬† Labyrinths .  We'd had exciting guests like¬† Malcolm Gladwell,   Jon Ronson ,  Dave Navarro ,  Michael Pollan ,  Sam Harris , and  LeVar Burton , among others, we've gotten wildly intimate in our miniseries about infertility and pregnancy, and we've opened our minds with psychedelic mushrooms!

I have taught Photoshop, Illustrator, and Computer Patternmaking for Fashion Design in Los Angeles for 13 years. While I was teaching I decided to turn my hobby of making embroidered velvet fezzes for my friends into something more. Over the years this went from a running gag, to a weekend hobby, and eventually into the business that is Fez-o-rama. I am continuously thrilled and amazed that something so ridiculous as designer velvet fezzes would find the audience and support needed to become the full-time jobs for both myself and my wife Maya as we continue to make every fez ourselves in our home studio. I am very proud of what we have accomplished, but there is a problem. The one thing I love more than making my art, is learning  new skills  to make  new stuff  and sharing that with others. Working for yourself tends to eat up a lot of time and it is easy to lose track of your passions. My goal with this Patreon page is to create a close knit community to share, collaborate, learn, and inspire.

ABOUT ME:¬† As for myself, you can think of me as a sort of Elvira for very odd videogames. I've been focusing on independent and esoteric technical art for nearly a decade. I'm an art critic, artist, designer and writer. I have written for games and art magazines alike, including Rhizome, Kill Screen, Paste, Kaleidoscope, Arcade Review, Vice and Billboard. I've also written about the labour and sociopolitical side of the tech industry for RankandFile and Passage. You can also check out some of my own little games here:  https://lanathegun.itch.io/ Formerly, I wrote reviews on a website called  Sufficiently Human , and unfortunately not all of those reviews were completed due to some past health issues. To make up for that, I would like to one day put together a small booklet of reviews for all the games I never got around to writing about--but that's a long-term project.  I apologize to past patrons for not being able to meet that promise, but I am trying to make up for it both with my current work and by the eventual completion of this project. When the booklet is ready, I will be sending it out at no charge to every patron before releasing it publicly.¬† I have made a couple of appearances on the podcast No Cartridge hosted by Trevor Strunk ( https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/no-cartridge-audio/e/62317350  and  https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/no-cartridge-audio/e/63781295 ).

I'm Jaimee Harris. For ten years I worked full time (typically, two to three jobs), wrote songs, sang background vocals on other artist's records, led bands, joined bands, played anywhere that would have me, and met you. Due to the kindness and generosity of my fans, I was able to record and release my first album. In 2018, I left my day job, fell in love, hit the road full-time, and moved to Nashville.  Along the way, I've learned how to be a publishing administrator, a booking agent, a promoter, a record label, a marketer, a social media manager, a web developer, a tour manager, and a travel agent. I can get by, but I'd love to focus on what I do best: writing, singing, performing, and recording. I love what I do and I know to do it well I can not do it on my own. [insert sound of angels singing] Enter Patreon.  I've chosen Patreon as the home of my Folk 'n Roll Fan Club because it  allows me to give you access to my soul's work directly . Right here. With your support, I'll not only be able to create more  (songs, videos, recordings)  but I'll also be able to take everything I do to a much higher level (guitar lessons, vocal coaching, songwriting workshops, great album artwork, PR campaigns for releases and tours, high-quality recordings and music videos, pyrotechnics, etc...). You will be directly contributing to my growth as an artist. The best part is,  you will see and hear everything first !  Why am I doing this?   I believe that songs have the power to be more than just entertainment. I knew from the time I was five years old that I wanted to write my own songs and share them with the world. You see, I've never fit in. I've always been an outsider. I've never been a great verbal communicator. However, I have always been able to communicate with songs. Whether it's sharing a song written by another artist to say \"this is how I feel,\" or writing my own songs and sharing them with the world. Songwriting has allowed me to help make sense of my trauma, my addiction, my recovery, my strained relationships, my mental health struggles, injustice, inequality, and joy. I believe it has saved my life. By sharing these creations with you, you help me to feel less alone. It keeps me alive. It keeps me here. It keeps me sane. It keeps me connected. It's my greatest wish that it helps you, too.¬† That was pretty Kumbaya, but I'm into the vibe. Why Patreon? Because I would love for you to be in my pinball league. Even though I started writing songs in 2004, I had never let anyone into my process until 2017. I was vulnerable, terrified, and insecure. What I've learned since then is that sharing the creative process with y'all is kind of like being in a band. There's more magic floating around. We all lift each other. If I keep everything to myself in my cave, there are so many creations that may never fly out into the light. I have sixteen years' worth of songs, but only ten songs made it onto my debut album.  There is so much more I have to share with you! ¬† Patreon allows me to share the creative process with you and gives me the space to share creative creations with you.  There's no suit telling me I have to wait three or four years to release content. It's just you and me. No BS. But, I'm not a bazillionaire.¬† Here's the deal -- I'm a folk singer. I sing songs for the folks. I was able to record, mix, master, and manufacture my debut record with 100% fan contributions. The average donation was $5! How does it work? As a Patron,  you decide how much you'd like to contribute  per month, starting at $3.¬† That's it. That's how it works.¬† All patrons will have access to everything I release in the Folk 'n Roll Fan Club. All of it.¬† Because of your support, I was able to play some incredible gigs, received invitations to legendary festivals, and sold out venues throughout Texas ---  all without having ever released a record.  That is NUTS. We've spent  years ¬†building this thing together. I want every single one of you to have access to recordings and anything else I'm inspired to create. I want your input.  What kind of things can I expect to see around here? Downloads of original Jaimee Harris songs . New original songs, alternate versions of older songs, and covers. Hear them here first. For some songs, this may be the only place to hear them...ever. Behind the scenes stories and pictures. ¬†Behind the Music...without the commercials.¬† Previews of completed projects . If I'm making a new record that will be released to the world, you will hear it first.¬† Patreon exclusive live streams. ¬†Total request live streams? Themed live streams? You vote. I'll play.¬† Patreon exclusive Q&A's and panels.  I've met so many creatives and activists over the last fourteen years of doing this work. I'd love to introduce you to these wonderful humans. Since activism is a huge part of my life, I'd like to offer you Patreon exclusive Zoom interviews with incredible humans who spend every day making the world a better place.¬† Patreon exclusive physical goods.

An album of archived material showed up in your inbox nearly every month in 2022...including the TOUGH SAILORS LP, also recorded in one day on New Years Day way back when in Joshua Tree. All of these posts are yours when you subscribe to this page. ¬† I used to travel the planet and play shows in order to earn the money to pay my bills and make more art. That has all changed in recent times, and the touring has slowed down considerably! This means I get to spend lots of quality time with my daughter, which I am very grateful for. In 2019 I played 120 shows. In 2020 I had 60 on the books, but all of that changed. 2021 was reasonable but I did get to go to Alaska and Denmark, and a mini West Coast run with Todd Snider. I have no manager, but I do have a booking agent. I am fairly independent in regards to the music business. I still long to play house concerts, and if you want to have one or know somebody that wants to have one, I am all about it.  ¬†In February, 2022, I unearthed three totes full of archival CDs and other material. Out takes, rarities, 4-track demos made in hotel rooms across America, unreleased songs, B-sides, and tons & tons of live shows. If you join me here, you will receive songs that nobody else gets. There are more than a few albums of material waiting for you in the older posts, and I have been fairly consistent with posting something new to Patreon every few weeks.  ¬†This Patreon platform is here to gather those friends and fans who believe in what I do and want to see me do more of it, unfettered, unfiltered, and with joy. I am asking you to join me as I chop down creative barriers with words, songs, and the unharnessed production of art. I wish to maintain complete independence in with my music and writing. Subscribing on Patreon is a way to cut out the filter that is between the creator and those that consume art. The first tier of being a Patron is quite reasonable. Two bucks a month and you get a song EXCLUSIVE TO PATRONS every month. That's a 12 song album at the end of the year that ONLY PATRONS HAVE. Also, you get the bonus albums that I drop each month such as demo collections from the past and the New Years Day 2022 \"Busker\" album. The monthly new songs are fully fleshed out demos for my commercial releases, filmed on video, with me playing all the instruments and having fun in general. I love to do this and having this platform to share it with you will help keep me focused. You get to see how I build the house, so to speak, and how the construction changes by the time the album is on the streets, which you also get before anybody else.¬† Projects on the horizon are plentiful. My next commercial album has basically been written, and all the demos are in the past posts that you get to unlock when you join us here. You will be getting the demos for new songs, but many are waiting in my monthly posts throughout the last two years. There will be videos and painted vinyl jackets¬†to accompany this batch of tunes.For a creative workaholic such as myself, I thank you listeners for your appreciation.

We are continually searching for brilliant artists and teachers, asking them to share their skills, techniques and tips in paint-along art webinars.

We strive to deliver fun, live events that feel professional and slick, while providing learning content that is impactful and effective. If we don't feel that our audience will learn something new, we won't broadcast it.

These are the expenses your contribution helps pay for: Artist reimbursement Searching and screening for top quality artists (many calls and emails) Camera setup and dummy runs Production and editorial (we don't make it up as we go along! Each class is scripted and planned) Hosting (each Art webinar is hosted to introduce the artist, select the correct camera angles during the show and filter audience questions) Overhead (insurance, taxes, rent, office expenses, internet, utilities) People who can afford to contribute make it possible for us to continue finding and featuring top talent in the art sphere.

Not being a gamer, myself, I moved on as an actor and, as the years went by, pretty much forgot about it.  That all changed in 2021.  It was the height of the pandemic and most of of my work had dried up. In February of that year, I was reminded by a fan that  Phantaz 2  was about to turn 25 years old. So, on a whim, I decided to broadcast a monthly livestream interview series to celebrate the 25th anniversary of P2, ending the project in December of 2021. So, that's what I did. I spoke to all the main players of the game (writer, director, editor, composer, actors) -- most of them for the first time since we wrapped -- and it was a BLAST! I had so much fun I didn't want to stop. So, I didn't. I live-streamed myself playing Phantaz 2 for the very first time. I started interviewing artists from the original Phantasmagoria and began a weekly play-thru of that game with the lead actress (Victoria Morsell Hemingson), began a retro-gaming happy hour on Fridays where my Patreon members decide what game I play next, and continue to interview numerous artists and creators from all sides of the retro-gaming universe. Thanks to my Patreon family, it seems that  Conversations With Curtis  is here to stay.¬†So please join me as we jump back in time and through dimensions as we explore the world of what early point n' click & FMV gaming aspired to be and the myriad amount of current communities they cultivated.  Where will this journey will take us? I don't have a clue. But I'm excited to find out. And I'd  love  your support along the way.¬†So, please grab yourself a Wyntech cubicle and help me grow this channel. Until then, I'll see you at the watercolor.

Here's the quick and easy low-down on who we are, and why we're asking for your support. Who We Are The Daily Grail  is a website that began way back in 1998, which is devoted to intelligent discussion of topics at 'the edges' of science and history. From new technology, discoveries and ideas, to all that weirder stuff that responsible, rational people are too scared to talk about, lest they be branded a 'woo-woo' (parapsychology, UFOs, etc.). We advocate exploration of these fascinating topics with an open, but critical mind, and checking your beliefs and ego at the door. Why We Need Your Help Getting up every morning and struggling to find the time and money to justify keeping a website running for 18 years may be a hell of a way to prove your integrity, but it's not always a barrel of fun. Collecting all the links we post in our daily news, and writing articles on fascinating topics, takes some serious hours (not even counting the behind the scenes work on website administration).¬† Sure, there's plenty of ways to earn some money. Other websites sell their members email addresses, hide commercial links in 'sponsored posts', and find other ways. We won't do that, because...well, because we're not a-holes. So we got to thinking. We have almost 10,000 daily readers. Maybe people appreciate what we do enough to drop just $1 a month on us (or a little more, if they feel it's justified), to not only help keep the site running, but allow it to improve! A new, mobile device-friendly design. A newsletter curating the best links of the week. More fascinating articles from great writers. Perhaps even a podcast if there's enough support out there. And maybe, we could even bring further rewards (than just the website being awesome) for those that back us. For just $12 a year - surely that would sound like a good deal?

See the membership tiers and choose the one that fits you best! Be sure to carefully read the tier benefits and frequently asked questions below, to make sure you understand what comes with each membership tier before signing up. I built Createful Art to serve those that want to become better painters and artists.  In order to become better, you need art lessons. Because without the knowledge or \"why\" behind the art, your skill level can't increase. The problem is that practice alone won't get you there. Which can make you wonder if you actually have the talent when progression is slow. I'm here to tell you, that of course, you do! I believe you have unlimited potential to create whatever it is YOU want. That feeling of discouragement when you can't is no fun. I don't want anyone to feel that way! I've been there.  I remember when I couldn't even paint clouds! So I turned to books, teachers, and artists for help. A lot of what I got back was confusing, missing important info, or taught in such a long way that I lost interest when they didn't get to the point! Why not make learning art so simple that we get it, move on, and progress faster? Why not make learning art fun and encourage creativity? People like you and me, who love art, well... we want to still love art while we are learning it. Eventually, I learned the key concepts and thereby gained the knowledge I needed to become confident in my abilities. I can now enjoy painting whatever it is I want in whatever style I feel like. I want you to feel confident and have this ability too! I also want to make it as¬†easy and pleasurable as possible for you to learn how to make art you'll love. FUN and EASY! Yay! This is how Createful Art Membership works... Step 1: Select a tier  that gives you the perks you want.¬† Step 2: Pace Yourself.¬† There's no need to paint everything as soon as I release it.¬†Pace yourself so that you can internalize the concepts. When you become a member you get access to a lot of content and more new tutorials and/or lessons weekly. Don't get overwhelmed, take the time you need, so you can actually enjoy the learning process.¬†¬† Step 3: Practice what you learn  with my tutorials. Feel free to change anything, in fact, I encourage it. Be creative! Now, watch yourself become a skilled artist, faster! Comments from Members \"I can't believe all that I am learning. Every time I study a lesson, I learn something new. Thank you Ashley.  \" ~ Shirley \"I am new to Creatful Art and so glad to be here. I loved making the llama!

Working on these colorful bright paintings truly changed my mood upside down .. so looking forward for painting the last one of this collection   thank u Ashley  \" ~ Samar About me:  My name is¬†Ashley Krieger. I'm a momma of three, a full-time traveling artist, art teacher, and YouTuber. I have created 200+ videos that teach art lovers like you, how to create art with fun tutorials and art lessons. It is my amazing members that help me do what I love the most, thank you for your support! You can get to know me more¬† right here . I hope you enjoy my art lessons, I can't wait to see your progress and have fun painting! Happy Painting, ~Ashley Frequently Asked Questions: How do I find the paintings I want to paint with you?  All the lessons are organized for you on my site by category¬† here . When you're a member and logged in to Patreon, click on the painting you want to enjoy with me and it will take you right to the post on Patreon. The login on my site will take you to log in here on Patreon, so there is no separate log-in on my site, just the one Patreon login here that gives you access. Where should I begin?  I recommend going through the  painting course here  that takes you from a beginner to a professional artist. I would practice painting by choosing a subject you want to  learn to paint here¬† - ¬†I have suggested an easy tutorial, to begin with under each subject. You could also begin, or practice, in an art journal -¬† https://www.createfulart.com/art_journal.html  with the lessons I send each week. Why do I not get access to previous lesson plans?  The lesson plans are incredibly valuable and worth more than the membership alone, as seen in my shop. Keep in mind that a 1hr, in-person painting lesson with me is valued at $100. I now design the same lessons into lesson plans, giving you the equivalent of $400+ worth of my knowledge and time each month for this extremely affordable price.  I also have to be fair to those who support me each month and my yearly members, who pay around $200 so they can enjoy each month's lesson plans. It wouldn't be fair to provide the same content to someone who comes for just a month and pays only $20 for access to the same amount of content.¬† ¬† Can I get a refund if I don't like the membership? ¬†No. Because of the subscription nature of Patreon, which is similar to other subscription services, you get instant access to membership content and can cancel your membership at any time, but you will not receive a refund. With Createful Art membership, you get instant access to hundreds of art lessons, video tutorials, and downloadable content. To protect creators from people signing up, downloading content, and then asking for refunds, Patreon and Createful Art have a strict no-refund policy. If you're unsure about joining, I recommend enjoying my five free art lessons, and my free tutorials on YouTube to make sure you love how I teach first. Remember that all the lessons are organized on my site to make it easy for you to find content -¬† https://www.createfulart.com/learn.html  and make sure you are logged in on Patreon to enjoy access. Why don't I see access to all your content?  I have people in previous tiers that receive less content than you. These are locked so you will easily find the posts with more content. I also give kids lessons, and those lessons you can sign up separately for. For some older videos, you will not get access to a full tutorial, because one was not made. However, you still have access to many full tutorials, and all of this is labeled clearly when you hover over the lessons organized for you on my site -¬† https://www.createfulart.com/learn.html  .¬†¬† If you have any additional questions before signing up, you are welcome to email them to me at  [email¬†protected]  and if you have any questions as a member, you will be able to message me through Patreon. Please keep in mind  that Patreon began as a place to support creators so that they could continue to offer the content you are enjoying. It wasn't built as a platform for a course or to find content prior to when you become a member. However, I have set up my website to make it possible to easily find previous content and access all my previous art lessons in order to make a course at the lowest price possible. It is because of Patreon that I can serve you and so many other people around the world. It is my goal to help you become a better artist, while doing that I have to be able to support my family so that I can continue to serve you.

You might know me from my weekly interview podcast,¬† Off Panel . Or perhaps you know me from my subscription comic site¬† SKTCHD  (which I own/operate), or my previous life at the Eisner Award nominated Multiversity Comics (which I was one of the senior editors at). Or maybe you discovered me through my¬† gigantic piece  on The Ringer about Image Comics' history or the one about¬† Spider-Man's place in the zeitgeist . There are a bevy of places you could find me, but the point is, I've been writing and talking about comics for a while now - 13 years! - and it's something I'm passionate about. I love comics, and I'd love to continue to keep Off Panel as something that isn't behind the paywall of SKTCHD. That's where you come in. The life of an independent podcaster is a fun one - I report to no one but myself - which means original takes and off the cuff interviews you might not get elsewhere. That's led me to podcasts interviewing some of the most interesting people in comics, including: Brian K. Vaughan   (Saga, Paper Girls) James Tynion IV   (Something is Killing the Children, The Nice House on the Lake) Tillie Walden   (Clementine, Spinning, On a Sunbeam) Ed Brubaker   (Reckless, Criminal) Patton Oswalt & Jordan Blum   (Minor Threats, Hulu's M.O.D.O.K.) Tom King  (Love Everlasting, Human Target) Daniel Warren Johnson   (Do a Powerbomb) Faith Erin Hicks ¬†(Ride On, The Nameless City) Kieron Gillen  (Immortal X-Men, A.X.E.: Judgment Day) Jonathan Hickman   (Three Worlds/Three Moons, X-Men) Now that SKTCHD has relaunched as a subscription site, the bulk of the content will be behind a paywall. And I don't want Off Panel to be like the rest, as I prefer to keep it open. This Patreon is now focused on doing that and offsetting the costs of the show (while making it worthwhile for me). I'm also always looking to beef up Off Panel and improve the overall quality of it, while also expanding the audience as much as I can. That can be expensive, either in actual money or simply time put in, and I'm looking to defray that however I can. Why should you support the show? Well, don't listen to me. Here are some smart people that aren't me saying nice things about Off Panel. \" Off Panel  is an oasis of great discussion on comics and the craft of making them. Every new show is the highlight of my week as I know I'll learn something new with every episode.\" - Declan Shalvey ( Injection ,  Moon Knight ) \"Like the best interviewers (and dodgeball players), David knows exactly when to get out of the way. I always learn something listening to  Off Panel .\" - John Allison ( Giant Days ,  Bad Machinery ) \"I began to take notice of David's work through his carefully researched comics journalism. And then he stopped. But all was forgiven once he started  Off Panel , a great outlet for his obvious enthusiasm about the medium and its craft.\" - Paolo Rivera ( The Valiant ,  Daredevil ) \"The best podcast about comics\" - super kind iTunes reviewer So there you have it. People like me. They really like me. And if you've enjoyed my interviews, I'd love to have your support. Anything helps.

My original hope with HawkBlogger was to create a respectful and passionate community that could come together to discuss what they love in a safe place. I believe Patreon will help us form that community because you have to pay to enter. Just being a random fan with a smart phone is not enough.  I would like to be writing for you, and providing the coverage you care about, and spend less time caring about the masses. It can make being a Seahawks fan even better. I know, because I have met many of you over the years.  So, join us. Let's build a community of great people to talk about the team we all love. About Brian (and HawkBlogger.com) 1984 - Became a Seahawks fan because my favorite colors were green and blue and we lived in Oregon 1993 - Went to college intending to be a sports journalist 1995 - Realized journalists were making $14K/year and the job market was shrinking, with little control over their schedules, so I started exploring other careers 1997 - Moved to Seattle after graduating and bought my first pair of Seahawks season tickets for $200. They were on the 50-yard line in the very last row of the Kingdome 2000 - Started writing a season preview for friends via email 2007 - Started my blog¬† hawkblogger.com  on the advice of a friend 2012 - Started accepting ad dollars and donating over 100% of proceeds to charity (Ben's Fund) 2013 - Watched front and center as my dream came true when the Seahawks whooped the Broncos in the Super Bowl 2015 - Crossed the $50K mark in donations to Ben's Fund 2017 - Started a Patreon page to create a closer connection with the most passionate Seahawks fans and turbo-boost annual contributions to charity Sports are an escape. There are precious few safe places to care passionately about something while actively disagreeing. Politics, religion, and even the food we choose to eat highlight what divides people and pushes them into smaller and smaller corners. People across all those divides come together to cheer, celebrate, and even hug one another in the name of sport. No sports community is stronger than the 12s who stand behind the Seahawks. My goal when I started  Hawkblogger.com  in 2007 was to create a place where Seahawks fans could gather and share in their obsession. I had graduated American University ten years prior with a degree in print journalism, with an eye on becoming a sports writer, but instead found success in technology working for Adobe Systems, Inc. The Seahawks were always my favorite team, and the blog provided the outlet I craved. Things started slowly, with just a handful of readers. That was plenty for me. It was a small community, but a community nonetheless. It grew into much more. Tens became hundreds and then thousands and now the top independent Seahawks blog on the web, visited by millions of people. It has been a thrilling and humbling experience. Unlike typical sports coverage, Hawkblogger.com prioritizes analysis over superficial breaking news. Long form articles are the norm. People come here to learn not only about their favorite team, but about the game they love. They hear from someone who has seen every Seahawks game since the mid-80s, and who obsessively catalogs every detail about team performance. Articles range from deep analytics to pure emotional experience. Reading  The Morning After  column has become a Seattle sports fan ritual. My job at Adobe means I do not need the revenue generated from this blog, so I made the decision in 2012 to donate all proceeds to charity. I have a two sons, and the youngest has special needs. John Schneider, GM of the Seahawks, has a son with autism. His wife, Traci, started a charity called Ben's Fund that benefits parents who cannot afford expensive autism treatments. It seemed like the perfect way to complete the virtuous cycle I had in mind when starting this blog.

This patreon enables the continued development of the show to be a reality.¬†  Each episode of the show is carefully researched and prepared based on interviews, developer presentations, research papers, technical reports, textbooks and - in some instances - from interviews with developers themselves.¬† This is a long and time consuming process once you add in scripting, recording of the game itself and editing, with  a typical episode of the main show taking over one working week to prepare \n and this naturally has a lot of running costs.¬†  I want to do more  and I believe in the value that  AI and Games  offers to so many people, but without the support of my audience, it's not sustainable.¬† In addition, while  AI and Games  receives a portion of revenue from adveriting on YouTube\n every month, it's a fraction of what my Patreon supporters provide and \nit a lot less consistent.  Hence  this Patreon is the main revenue \nstream  of the channel.  While I respect how unreliable YouTube is as a platform, I hope that you - my audience - would like to support the work.¬† Naturally, if you can't or don't support the show, that's absolutely fine!¬† I don't expect it of you all.¬† However, I do reward my supporters with extra goodies which I detail further down this page. ---- Why AI and games? Artificial intelligence is a big talking point these days and I use \nthis video series to talk about it in the context of games.  I run a \nseries of videos that address this topic in different ways: Case Studies How artificial intelligence is  applied   in commercial video games . How  AI research in games  is used to enhance our understanding of the field. AI 101 Explaining core AI tech in the games industry, how it works and clever ways it is used in games. Design Dive How AI applications in games  influence game design . I have an almost endless supply of new topics to cover and videos to make - and I need you to help make that a reality. ---- Why Use Patreon? Patreon - where we are right now - is a service where you can pledge support to a creator (in this case me) so they can support their work and continue to make it a reality. ¬†Patreon is great for creators such as myself given I can remove any need for sponsorship and instead focus on creating content that my viewers are excited about. ¬† ---- How Do Payment and Rewards Work?

I spend some years travelling around the world as a digital nomad and after many adventures, I settled down in Spain to focus on  developing my artistic and literature projects . If you came here to take a peek at what I‚Äôm doing or support my weirdness, THANK YOU. I've been creating content for years, in front of and behind the cameras, through my social networks,¬† YouTube  and the media I write for. My goal is to be able to  keep making projects that are interesting for me and my audience , without giving in to the demands of the market or the requirements of the media. Why Patreon?  The cost of creating is high, and for many years I‚Äôve spent more time and resources looking for distributors and sponsors instead of doing what I really have to do: CREATE. Patreon allows my content to be  independent, diverse and also risky. Self-managed and self-funded . Free from the limits imposed by brands and distributors. This platform is designed so that people who want to help me to continue creating can do so by contributing monthly the amount of money they decide . This way I can focus entirely on creating Stuff‚Ñ¢ that I believe without having to think about ‚Äúwhat will sell more.‚Äù Artworks, photo shoots, videos, texts and much more! My challenge for 2020 is to publish my second book, an essay about feminism in which I analyze the experience of going through the world as a woman. Besides allowing me to skip the commercial system, Patreon helps me  to connect directly with my followers . Create a direct relationship with each of you and that we can, together, build a community where we share our thoughts and ideas. If all this seems interesting and you want to  join me in this creative process , you are in the right place! ‚ô• ¬†‚ô• ¬† What‚Äôs this, how does it work?  - ¬†Patreon is a micro patronage website. This means that you can contribute the amount of money YOU decide each month, and in return you will receive different rewards like stickers, original artwork, exclusive content and my unconditional love. By clicking on \"Become a Patron‚Äù and filling the required information, you'll get access to exclusive posts instantly. And don't worry, you can withdraw your contribution at any time :) For more info, visit the  Patreon FAQ . What happens when I pledge? - ¬†You will see a confirmation page. If your pledge amount comes with digital rewards you'll be able to see a post in the creator‚Äôs section where I explain how to access the patron-only area. Physical rewards are sent at the beginning of the next month. What will you use the money for? - I firmly believe that if we all share the knowledge we have, the world would be a much better place. That‚Äôs why I want to focus on projects that involve as much public content as possible. But to get to this point I need support, help and patronage. I need to pay for my video and photography equipment, and the people who work with me. The costs to develop and maintain my website, the gas, the tickets. That‚Äôs why I come to you.¬† I still don't understand, please help me!  -  Don't panic! I understand that this system may seem complicated at first. If after reading this FAQ you still have any doubts about how it works or how to pledge, please send an email to¬† [email¬†protected]   and I will help answer your questions. Where can I find out more about you and your projects?  -  You can find me on  Twitter ,  Instagram ,¬† Facebook  and of course my¬† YouTube  channel and my personal¬† website .

I‚Äôve been publicly writing about witchcraft and Paganism since 2010 and my message has remained constant throughout this time. I‚Äôm not the witch who‚Äôs going to hold your hand and tell you you‚Äôre pretty. I‚Äôm not going to fluff your ego and accept your excuses because I  know  you‚Äôre capable of better. If you want to deepen your practice, to be a more effective and self-reliant witch, and to strengthen your relationship with the Land, spirits, and Gods, I want to help you however I can. To that end, I provide intense divination services via throwing the bones, have produced 100+ articles, have written 13 hands-on courses, have published three books, and have more books and courses on the way. Your support provides me with a consistent income that allows me to scale back on my freelance writing clients and focus more heavily on helping people navigate the interlap between their spiritual and everyday lives, take their witchcraft deeper, and become more effective witches.  \n\n How I began Writing and Why At the end of 2010, my husband and I created a website called The Tarot Witch. It was a small attempt to combat the growing mountain of misinformation concerning witchcraft and Paganism with weekly and, later, bi-monthly articles. Around that same time, I started blogging, sharing glimpses into my personal practice, as well as sharing with you my and my husband‚Äôs experiences in raising our children Pagan and as witches and how we function as a family coven (or local family cultus if you want to get technical‚Ä¶) When The Tarot Witch was later shut down in 2012, the numerous articles were moved to my blog and I continued to write the bi-monthly articles as a continued effort to provide sincere and experienced based information that others could use to, hopefully, deepen their understanding of why they did things a particular way in order to strengthen their practice. I continued to write through multiple pregnancies, while juggling going to school full time and working full time, while being homeless, and even while living in the middle of the wilderness in New Mexico without power or internet.  It‚Äôs never been about the money, which is why my website has  always  been ad-free and I‚Äôve never once pushed affiliate links or products even when I really,  really  could have used the money. I write because I am compelled to, and I write about witchcraft because after so many years of practice I cannot imagine my life without it. The support and feedback I‚Äôve gotten from you, my treasured readers, keeps me motivated and is the entire reason I made the push to start writing books and have now managed to write 13 courses on witchcraft in just 4 years. \n\n Where the Money Goes Pledges are used to cover the costs of hosting my website and sending monthly newsletters. This supports the writing that I am currently and have been doing for 12 years. From there, pledges will be used to defer my meager living costs, allowing my family to continue to enjoy our wandery, wilderness lifestyle, and for me to devote my writing time to turning out more consistent content for  you  rather than focusing on writing for clients. There is no way for me to accurately convey how much every pledge means to me. I can only hope that the higher quantity of work that I‚Äôm able to produce thanks to your help serves to help people deepen their practices and to do more witchcraft when they may have otherwise made excuses. \n\n How Patreon Works Patreon enables creators like me to receive predictable income each month by providing a place for fans (you) to receive extra content and exclusive rewards in exchange for a small pledge. That pledge provides a predictable income that relieves some of the stress of freelance life and allows me to focus more consistently on writing on the topics that we both love. In exchange, and depending upon how much you pledge, you will receive exclusive witchcraft courses, digital copies of my self published books, access to full-size courses, and membership to my private witch community filled with toothy witches who are just as ready to discuss the deep side of witchcraft as they are to joke around and support each other through challenges in our everyday lives and spirituality. All of this is just a small way for me to show my endless appreciation for your support and encouragement. Patreon charges immediately when you first pledge and then at the 1st of the month thereafter. You are able to pledge any dollar amount you wish, however, to get the rewards associated with any tier, you must pledge at least the amount of the desired reward tier (i.e, you can pledge $15 and be at the $10 reward tier or pledge $30 and be at the $20 tier, for example). If you wish to make a one-time pledge, you can pause or cancel your pledge once the charge has gone through and Patreon will no longer take payments.

In 2012 we started a new series, Hero-U, set in a University for would-be heroes. Hero-U: Rogue to Redemption launched in 2018, and we're currently working on Summer Daze at Hero-U, with several others in the pipeline. Check out our newest games at¬† https://www.hero-u.com . Our games are different from most games out there. One reviewer used the words \"charm\" and \"heart\" for the type of stories we tell. Quest for Glory and Hero-U do not fit neatly into the usual game categories - They are adventure games, RPGs, dramatic stories leavened with humor and puns, mysteries, visual novels, and relationship games among a few others. Our games are not about pulse-pumping action, adrenaline, and shooting things, although some of them feature combat and stealth. They are about story and characters... and humor. Here's the thing - Although many players have written to tell us how much they love our games, we have a limited market. We appeal to gamers who love deep, detailed stories and character relationships. That's a harder sell than \"run around and shoot things!\" For now, at least, we make critically- and player-acclaimed games that don't sell enough copies to pay for their development. We raised over $500,000 on Kickstarter for Hero-U: Rogue to Redemption, but paying our developers and other expenses cost over $1 million. So far, we haven't come close to recovering that extra cost through game sales. One way for us to keep making games is to take our living expenses out of the equation. If we receive enough support here on Patreon and from other donations, we can pour all of the game income back into making more games. That's what this Patreon page is about - If you loved our games, or want to see us keep making games with heart that defy traditional categories, help us pay our expenses so we can focus on getting the games to pay for themselves. You will get some nice things too! We have some pretty cool stuff in our archives that nobody has seen in a long time. We wrote a Quest Log about games, game development, and world events. We edited the Spell Book fantasy gaming magazine with articles, stories, and poetry. We plan to regularly reprint some of those articles here, just for our Patrons.

Way back in high school (2012...totally not that long ago) ¬†I started playing with clay and man was I in love with the stuff! There was just one problem, I hated how once it was baked and painted that was it, you couldn't change anything about it. I couldn't stand that as I always wanted to re-position them in a ¬†pose I thought would be more fitting. It bugged me so much that I had to see if there was any way around it. I was certainly not disappointed when I discovered art dolls, it was exactly what I as looking for. A realistic looking and feeling sculpture that moves! Never stuck in a single pose and is interactive. The addiction began then and 4 years later I'm even more in love. In the past 4 years I've had enormous joy making and sharing these creations with you, Connecting with you guys, and just recently opening the doors to this beautiful art form for you all to learn and try for yourself! While I don't plan on giving this up anytime soon I will admit it is really hard to manage my passion and function in the real world and this is where I'm hoping you can help me! I am burning with passion and dreams to make this a full-time reality. While that does get the ball rolling, finances and lack of time can really hinder things. I currently work 40+ hours a week working a \"real 8-5 job\" On a typical day I have around 4-5 hours of free time and in that time I have to cook, clean, do any errands I may need and then try to get in the zone and let my imagination flow. ¬†After awhile that can run anyone down! My dream is to be able to make art full-time as my career and teach and inspire people to let their imaginations flow! This is will take many years for me to accomplish alone but with your help I think we can get there! With your donations I will be able to expand the horizons on my art, my set ups for how I teach you and lets be honest pay the bills! I will be able to be full time and share all my ideas freely with the world! I of course have perks for you guys as a huge thank you for taking a leap of faith in me. I have so many cool things planned for Patreon like: Exclusive PDF tutorials and videos only you guys will get! Get access to sales, adoptions and videos before anyone else Behind the scenes and work in progress shots¬† Exclusive giveaways¬† Discounts if you'd like to adopt one of my creations¬† Full length videos of art dolls to really get a detailed look on how things are done!

I am among some very admired, respected and hugely dedicated journalists that include Eva Bartlett, Sharmine Narwani, Whitney Webb and Finian Cunningham.  The award is in memory of Serena Shim who exposed the criminal incubation of terrorism inside Turkey and its export into Syrian territory via the Turkish borders. Serena was very probably murdered by Turkish intelligence for daring to expose their role in the destabilisation of their neighbour, Syria. Thank you Serena for being a lone light in the darkness during 2014, you are an inspiration to so many. I will do my best to live up to the example you set for us.  2018 - British National Council for the Training of Journalists (NCTJ) named Vanessa Beeley as one of the Top 238 most respected journalists in the UK. http://www.nctj.com/latestnews/nctj-publishes-list-of-most-respected-journalists My work needs me to be able to travel to the areas where my government and your government are doing the most damage, where the people of those countries are not given a fair hearing by the state-aligned media that is working within a frame that best serves their government, the military industrial complex and the corporatocracy. The majority of \"official\" media outlets in the West are agents for power. I aspire to be a humble agent for the people in any way I can and my most effective contribution is my voice and my words that can transmit the voices of the \"disappeared\" and the \"unheard\".¬† We are all struggling and I have a total aversion towards asking for anything for myself but I simply cannot continue to do what I do without your financial help. I promise that I will continue to dedicate pretty much every waking hour to my research, travel, speaking and writing in protest against the perpetual cycle of war and chaos that is being generated by the ruling establishment and their aligned institutions, including the colonial media.¬† We cannot fight alone, we are all connected by the human threads that bind us. Thank you. ‚ÄúInjustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.‚Äù  - Martin Luther King Read more about me and find more of my work at¬† www.thewallwillfall.org One of my most important investigations has been into the NATO-member-state financed pseudo \"humanitarian\" non-NGO operating in Islamofascist controlled areas of Syria - the White Helmets. Below you will find a selection of my work on this shadow state, propaganda construct that has worked to criminalise the Syrian government and Syrian Arab Army on behalf of their bankrollers in the West and Gulf states. The much acclaimed journalist and filmmaker,¬† John Pilger  has endorsed my work on the White Helmets:¬† \"Vanessa is a fine reporter, who was one of the finalists in the 2017 Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism, perhaps the most distinguished award for truly independent journalism in Britain, which the Guardian itself was proud to receive in the past. What the bullies and censors can't stand is that she has exposed the fraudulence of the UK and US funded 'White Helmets' and so they resort to craven smears.\" International criminal lawyer,¬† Christopher C Black  made this statement about the White Helmets:¬† ‚ÄúNicolo Machiavelli wrote in The Prince that deception is the principal means by which people can be controlled.  Sun Tzu in The Art of War stated that the art of deception is the first art of war, above all others, and it is deception that the citizens of the NATO countries are faced with in the aggression being conducted against the government and people of Syria. Using special propaganda units such as The White Helmets, which several NATO countries now freely admit they finance and support, the aggressor nations try to justify their war against Syria. Part of the deception is that this unit is a non-governmental organisation but the admissions about NATO support destroy that argument. They are clearly a very governmental organisation. But more than that the work of Vanessa Beeley, Eva Bartlett, Mark Taliano and others about their origins, military and intelligence connections and operations establishes that they are in reality a military propaganda unit, acting within the units of the proxy forces they support, carrying weapons, engaging in hostilities on the side of the NATO proxy forces, acting as a cover for their crimes, generating anti-Syrian disinformation and, when the proxy forces flee government forces, fleeing with them. They are not a ‚Äúhumanitarian aid group‚Äù to be praised but a military propaganda unit, combatants in disguise, to be condemned. And since they are part of the NATO war machine attacking Syria they are war criminals.‚Äù  SELECTION OF ARTICLES and INTERVIEWS - I will be adding to them daily.¬† THE REAL SYRIA CIVIL DEFENCE The REAL Syria Civil Defence¬† Exposes Fake 'White Helmets' as Terrorist-linked Imposters.¬† The REAL Syria Civil Defence¬† Saving Real Syrians NOT Oscar Winning White Helmets Saving Al Qaeda.

Room Escape Artist   began in 2014 with our musings about escape rooms. Seven years and more than 2,000 blog posts later, it's grown into so much more than a daily publication. Daily Publication Reviews   - We review real-life escape rooms as well as online and tabletop escape games. Our reviews commend ingenuity and provide constructive feedback. In 2021, we expanded our writers and added hivemind reviews where we share multiple perspectives within a single review. Commentary  - These thought pieces unpack and analyze issues in the escape room community Interviews  - We share the stories of the extraordinary players and creators we meet through interviews. Beyond Writing REPOD  - On The  Reality Escape Pod , hosts David Spira & Peih-Gee Law explore immersive gaming from all angles, alongside guests with incredible experience in this realm. After a successful first season in early 2021, we welcomed Neil Patrick Harris on Season 2 Episode 1. Resources Directory  - We maintain a¬† directory  of escape room facilities in the United States. Industry Reports  - We release annual data-driven¬† industry reports , based on trends from our directory and more detailed reports based on survey data of industry professionals and players. Awards  - Each year, our Golden Lock Award highlights some finest escape rooms in the world. Events RECON  - The¬† Reality Escape Convention  is our annual convention that brings escape room professionals and players together for 2 days of connection, learning, and sharing. RECON will be back digitally (accessible globally!) in August 2021 after a successful 2020 event. Escape Immerse Explore  - Since 2017, we‚Äôve hosted¬† escape room tours  to escape room destination cities where you can play some of the most impressive escape rooms in the world with teammates who will truly appreciate these experiences. Meetups  -  In our local New York City and whenever we travel, we bring the community together to share ideas, trade stories, and find teammates. Media Speaking Engagements  - We speak at conferences and other industry events about different facets of the escape room industry. Journalists  - We help journalists get the insights and connections they need to cover this industry. These publications include The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, USA Today, and¬† CBS Sunday Morning . All of the content at RoomEscapeArtist.com is available for FREE. The Patreon doesn't change that. However, the support we‚Äôve received since we launched this Patreon in 2018 has led directly to the creation of RECON and REPOD, and to many specific pieces we‚Äôve researched and written over the years, among other projects. We wouldn‚Äôt be where we are today with our community of Patreon backers and the incredible team of people who write for REA, produce the podcast, manage the directory, create the insane undertaking that is RECON, and advise us at every turn. Please join our Patreon community and support us in providing resources to enable a sustainable escape room industry for many years to come. \n \n \n Future Growth \n Upgrade the website infrastructure  so that you can more easily find the content you seek. Launch a new¬†directory  with a mobile-friendly UI for you, less work on the backend for us, and new features for everyone. Write more commentary pieces ... the type that takes many hours of¬†research,¬†interviews, and¬†data analysis. Highlight games in the other parts of the United States . Our travels thus far have been primarily coastal, and occasionally international. We know that there are many more incredible games in other parts of this country just waiting to be discovered, written about, and shared.¬† Develop new types of events  ‚Äì like the¬†Escape Immerse Explore tours & RECON ‚Äì that bring like-minded folks together. Launch  a whole bunch of super-secret projects that we aren‚Äôt sharing yet!¬† \n \nYou will support our mission to provide well-researched, rational, and reasonably humorous pieces that push the industry forward. You will support our efforts to build a community of players and creators that will sustain the escape room industry for the future.\n We both work day jobs. All of the content you read is created on weekends and in the evenings‚Ä¶ and late into the night. We are at capacity. We have more ideas than we can possibly create in off hours. With your support, we will give more time to Room Escape Artist. \n \n Curious where the names for the support levels come from? \n Our Not-So-Secret Origin Story \n \nWe met in a bar on a snowy evening, only a few days after David had visited Escape the Room NYC, the first escape room to open on the east coast of the US.  \"David was describing this room filled with interactive puzzles and the excitement of solving them in the nick of time. I was intrigued.\" \"I asked for her number... and now we're married and writing this blog together.\"¬† \nAs we played escape rooms together in 2014, we encouraged our friends to join in. David wrote a blog post called \n Real Life Escape the Room 101  (on his personal blog) to give folks a sense of what to expect going in. That calmed fears of the unknown and created more functional team dynamics. \n \nThen we brought some friends to a really terrible room. That happened in the early days because the Internet couldn‚Äôt tell us which games would be good. David decided to give the Internet some knowledge. He wrote a review warning people away from this escape room‚Ä¶ and promising that it didn‚Äôt represent all escape rooms.\n \n \nIn August of 2014, we spent an afternoon with the Internet, searching for all escape rooms in the US. The first step to playing them was finding them. Lisa made a Google map and its companion Google sheet.\n \n \nWe launched Room Escape Artist with these few blog posts and a directory of¬† 2 dozen escape rooms . We wanted to share our love of letting strangers lock us inside giant puzzles, and to push the makers of those giant puzzles to create the best experiences they can. \n \nSince that snowy evening in a bar,¬† David proposed  (with a puzzle box!), we got married (with a¬† wedding puzzle! ), and we started a life together. David thinks up new ideas. Lisa keeps the ideas going. Together, we built a thing much bigger than each of us. \n \n Words from the Community \n \n \n‚ÄúYou put the fuzzy ideas I had about escape rooms into words much better than I could!‚Äù ‚Äì Joanna¬† \n \n‚ÄúI read Room Escape Artist every day. I have no idea how you two do it, and I am personally in debt to you as an escape room owner. You're bringing up the escape room industry into a mature art form.‚Äù ‚Äì Haley E. R. Cooper, Strange Bird Immersive, Houston, TX, USA\n \n \n‚ÄúYour blog has been an invaluable resource as I have designed and am now building my first Escape Room(s). You critiques encourage and frighten me. My decisions are influenced by this question: \n What would David & Lisa think? ¬†The answer compels me to reach a litter higher... Thanks.‚Äù ‚Äì Jim, Paradox Squared, Woodstock, IL, USA ‚ÄúRoom Escape Artist is a gem in the vast desert of the escape room/puzzle scene. With their daily coverage and detailed reviews, David and Lisa Spira are doing something extraordinary.‚Äù ‚Äì Ben Rosner, New York, NY, USA \n \n‚ÄúYour description about 'The Question of Best' is why REA is so valuable to the rest of us. 'Best' is a flawed term for escape rooms, but without question, is not going away. There is no 'Best' ice cream flavor though there are definitely favorites. What makes an ice cream flavor good? That requires a more nuanced exploration, depends on personal preferences, and so much more. That is what REA gives us readers. Thank You!‚Äù ‚Äì David Longley, Arizona, USA\n \"R oom Escape Artist  is the wittiest, most resourceful escape room guide out there. Lisa and David allow enthusiasts to live vicariously through their adventures, giving readers a sneak peek into a wide variety of rooms while somehow not spoiling any of the mystery behind what makes the room so fun to solve on your own. Best of all, in an industry where recommendations are hard to trust,  Room Escape Artist  gives you the tools you need to decide for yourself what room to experience next. ‚Äì Kate Wastl, Buffalo, NY, USA \n \n‚ÄúI have nothing but genuine respect and admiration for Lisa and David.

Make +Mend was once a brick and mortar space but in March 2020  we said good-bye to our tiny shop and we have now moved to a fully digital platform, based out of the Joy Street Studios, serving the makers of the Boston artist community and beyond!

We manage Books and Bao, a literature, travel, and culture site. Books and Bao explores and celebrates the best of literature in translation from around the world, as well as queer fiction and books by people of colour. We publish regular articles and YouTube videos that share our love of world literature. As digital nomads, we also take deep cultural dives into every place we visit, sharing articles and videos about food, architecture, history, art, and more. What will you be funding? As both a website and a YouTube channel, we put out weekly content in both written and video form, with the dual goal of educating and entertaining. Our written articles take the form of reviews, listicles, analyses, interviews, and recommendations. Our videos include frequent book reviews, Q&As, lists, personal vlogs, and artist spotlights. Our site publishes at least one new article each week, while also consistently updating old content to keep it relevant. Our YouTube channel publishes at least two videos each week, keeping up-to-date with the best of current literature. Managing both of these takes an increasing amount of work, and you will help to fund the production of every part of that. Your support allows us to continue putting more and more time and effort into both our written and our video content. Why support Books and Bao on Patreon? We do what we do because we believe, in earnest, in the wonders of world literature, in the digital nomad lifestyle, and in seeing the most meaningful parts of every country and culture. We want to make a lasting impression on the worlds of literature and travel. We also want to be the best writers, filmmakers, and editors we can be. Your support will go a long way to support that. With your support, we can put even more time and effort into providing travel and literature content for you to read and watch.

I‚Äôve released a ton of original music, covers and some very fun videos that have reached millions of viewers around the world. \n \nFor many young musicians, this is the dream and I am so fortunate and grateful to be at this place in my career. \n \n \n \n DMF is so much more than a band. We are a community. We are a family.  \n \n \nI‚Äôve seen first hand the affect that the music and videos can have to \n heal & inspire  within our DMF family. From sparking a smile, brightening someone‚Äôs day, helping them through depression or suicidal thoughts, or even inspiring people chase their own crazy dreams, the impact within our community is incredibly powerful. So many of our fans have found best friends through the music. Countless people have told me how the music has given them hope to persevere through tough times.  \n \n That is exactly what DMF stands for... Perseverance. \n I have had so many stumbling blocks and immense setbacks in my own journey that have led me to almost give up my music and everything I‚Äôve fought so hard to achieve.  Sometimes the healer is the one that actually needs the healing.  \n \n \n But if you know me, you know that  I will never give up.  \n \nAnd I know that you believe in me and the music. Your support keeps me going.¬† \n So here‚Äôs the deal... \n \nWelcome to the Future. The only time we should ever be looking back is to see how far we come.\n \nUnderstanding the impact we can make is so important. DMF is evolving. This is about\n  passionately  creating great content, building a strong community and inspire others to be the best that they can be. Change is in the air and have learned a lot about what works and what doesn‚Äôt work. I will be creating art with more passion than you have ever seen before. And I want to grow and change with you. \n \nAnd that is where Patreon comes in and helps strengthen this process.¬†\n \n \n What is Patreon? \n Honestly... Just watch this!¬† Patreon is an incredible platform that enhances our relationship! You can directly support the music and creation and get some \n sweet rewards  as a thank you for your support!¬†In essence you become a patron of the art (hopefully you like our art :).

Without you, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find the resources to create and release the content I want to create.  Soooooo...I need your support, your patronage, YOU, so that I can continue share more art with you. When I‚Äôm inspired, I like to create, and  you guys make it possible! You guys keep me doing what I love to do! I am SO fortunate to have you!\n \n \n**You can contribute as much as you want or nothing at all!

We hated that job but it was during that time we spent every free moment creating ideas for a world together. After giving up on art for years, my passion was restored in the excitement of drawing ideas for a fantasy world the two of us created. My older brother Kyle went to school for literature, creative and script writing. As we both felt lost, without a purpose and direction in life, we set our ambition on improving our creative skills and chasing a dream to create our first comic. Five years have passed since that day and we are so fortunate to have met such an amazing supportive community online. Our drive and motivation for this project has only become stronger, with your help, we hope to truly make this dream come true. ¬† ¬† \"How does it work?\" ¬† Our goal is to make Project Divider our main focus, by creating a Patreon we hope to raise enough for Project Divider to be a monthly comic/manga release!

I livestream 5 days\na week at twitch.tv/cahlaflour and play video games/spend time with my\ncommunity. I am a variety streamer that has a big focus in the horror genre (my\nmain game is currently Dead by Daylight).\n \n \n \nFor starters \nNo one is required to sign up for Patreon. I will continue\nto stream and create content on my social media. This is extra. Patreon is a\nplace for people to support my hobby (cosplay, behind the scene work, photography\netc). It is a monthly subscription where you pledge a dollar amount and get\nspecific rewards depending on your pledge!¬† \n \n What Your Pledge Means for my Channel \n Your support here means my career as a content creator is more stable. It's no secret that the gaming industry is very unpredictable and it can be very stressful on creators. Your support on Patreon means that I get to focus more on the games that I enjoy for stream and less about the numbers and paying my bills. Simply put: your support will help me focus on giving you the best content I can. \n \n What Your Pledge Means for You \n You'll get to follow along my content creation journey in a far more intimate way than you can anywhere else. I'll be posting things here that never make it to any other platform. I post random selfies/snapchats/videos, plans for the channel, cosplay work, get feedback from patrons, share announcements early and so much more! Patreon is a platform where I can be more personal with my audience. We have monthly Google Hangouts sessions where a big chunk of my community gets together and spends a night hanging out with each other. I'm very proud to say my patrons have become a super tightknit group of friends who are always around to support one another and myself. You'd get to be a part of that.¬†Think this might be something that interests you? Take a look around and check out some of the rewards offered here. \n \n \n \n \nFAQ:\n \n \n Q :  How often do you upload content to Patreon? \n \nA : Nearly every day! Exceptions might be when I‚Äôm traveling for stream\nopportunities and conventions but during these periods I‚Äôll be filming content\nfor Patreon. There is a Patreon snapchat that I try to post on daily with\nupdates, behind the scenes, real time cosplay work, pictures, videos you name\nit. I do multiple posts each week to the Patreon feed as well. It‚Äôs pretty busy\nin here!\n \n \n \nQ : Can I get rewards from previous months? \n \nA : Unfortunately rewards from previous months are specific to those months (if\nit is a physical reward package, digital content will always be able to be seen\nin later months you might just have to do some searching around). Sometimes I\nwill have a few things left over from previous months and I‚Äôll throw those in\nwhen people sign up for the Twilight tier (previous months stickers, perlers,\nart etc). Those aren‚Äôt ever guaranteed but I will throw in extras when I have\nthem for people newly signing up to that tier.\n \n \n Q : When will my package be shipped out? \n A : Packages are shipped out 2 months at a time. Example: January and February's packages will ship out together a few weeks into March to allow for pledges to be processed and packaging. I do this all by myself so please be patient! \n \n Q : What if I don't want to receive a physical package in the mail? \n A : Not a problem at all, when you sign up do not include a mailing address! I will more than likely reach out just to double check with you and make sure you didn't forget it. Don't be worried if I do, I just want to make sure everyone is getting what they're paying for! \n \n \nQ : Isn‚Äôt Patreon for NSFW content? \n \nA :¬†Nope! I am not into creating that kind of content, more power to the others\nout there that do, it just isn‚Äôt my style. You may find a cosplay to be a bit\nsexier occasionally, but it will never be NSFW or nude. I like being a goof and\nderping around. That‚Äôs more me.\n \n \n \nQ : When will I be charged for my pledge? \n \nA : As soon as you sign up or upgrade your tier. After that you will be billed\nthe first of the month. You will have until the last day of each month to make\nsure you signed up to receive the physical mailed out rewards for that month\n(plus its digital content). Example: You sign up as a $50 patron in January and\nupgrade your tier to $100 January 31st. You will be charged the extra $50 on\nthe upgrade day and you will be a Twilight dragon for January. Then you will be\ncharged $100 February 1st for February‚Äôs package. If you‚Äôre ever unsure, check\nyour email to see exactly what the pledge was for.\n \n \n \nQ : I‚Äôm having an issue with Patreon billing? \n \nA : If you ever have any questions or issues with Patreon billing, please refer\nto this page: \n https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/categories/360000481411-PATRON-BILLING \n \n \nQ : This didn‚Äôt answer my question? \n \nA : If your issue isn't listed or your question answered from\nreading those topics, please send them a ticket with your issue: \n https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/requests/new \n \nPlease note that the creators have nothing to do\nwith billing, they are busy creating content for you!

Ive found location can be a crucial key to unlocking these essentials.  ¬† Fortunately for me, I was blessed by the luck of the draw. Born in Lake Tahoe California I was granted with an appreciation for nature at infancy. Even now the smell of the pine trees is forever engraved in my senses. Relaxing me, grounding me, reminding me, to just slow down and breathe. In times of stress, anger, depression or anxiety, I believe spending some alone time in a large body of water, can be the best natural medicine. Knowing these healing properties of our precious lake, only sparked a curiosity to find more of earths ancient truths. Ive walked the deserts of Egypt, scuba dived in the Caribbean, sang karaoke in Japan & danced the night away in Paris. ¬† I tell you that, to tell you this. The connection between all those moments was human. Regardless of location, I was able to interact with all walks of life. They embraced me, taught me, protected me, as well as changed me in ways I cant describe. I will say however, at the core of our hearts, we all long for connection and acceptance. One of the best ways to express these feelings, is also one of the best ways to unite the masses. MUSIC. The universal language rooted into the very fabric of a soul. You know what it is, you know what it means to you, but like most of us you cant always find the words that speaks your truth. Music unapologetically holds every thought or emotion you have ever had and never had.  ¬† I understand the importance of that legacy. I want to do my best to add to an already vast world of inspiration. My hopes is that I can make music from the heart, that will speak to the soul. We're all in this together, learning thru living.

My name is  Kels , also known around the internet as  KM Steere, ¬† Keymonster  or just  Key . I am a full time, freelance artist and illustrator working out of the Pacific Northwest. My creative passions center around animals, plants and the fantastical worlds they exist in. I love creating plant/animal hybrids and integrating botanical motifs and imagery into the worlds that I build as well as creating adorable little creatures of all shapes and sizes getting into a bunch of mischief.¬† I started this Patreon page to give myself a steady income as well as allow my followers to help fund the exploration of new ideas, projects and merchandise. I love being able to interact with followers of my work and Patreon is a nice, centralized place for me to be able to do that without all the clutter of social media channels. As my Lovely Forest grows I will be able to dip my toes into some of these things: Process and Technique Discussion: I generally don't share much about my art making process, mostly because it tends to involve a lot of scribbling and not a lot of technical or program jargon, but I will try to post about parts of my process including references I use, some techniques I have picked up or are currently experimenting with and struggles I'm having with certain parts of being a freelancer. Tutorials are not really my thing but they will pop up from time to time. I should also mention that I love cats, and I love creating art with cats. I often will use cats as the testers for new ideas or techniques for projects, and this platform will give you the opportunity to suggest themes for these cats. I swear I don't have a problem! World Building: I love making worlds in my head. I also love creating fantasy species and races that will go into those worlds. I have a few actually written down (see below) but mostly I love making fae creatures and other magical beings that could live along side us in our world, or exist in their own parallel to ours. Some of the worlds I enjoy building on and creating in are:¬† Verdant Fae As I mentioned above I love making fae creatures. My idea generally springs from the concept of magic in everything but on a different plain of existence. Fae are the creatures that can channel these magics through themselves to manifest it in the physical world. In my own headcannon fae can include anything from dragons to pixies, foxes to mushroom peoples.¬†¬† Donair Donair is a fantasy story based on a dream I had a while ago. I wrote everything down and my partner and I became hooked on figuring out little details about the character and how the world worked as well as the idea of potentially turning it into a RPG some time in the future. Donair is based off of elements and how they interact with each other in a world torn apart by dynastic war.¬† The World of M.E.C.A.   Without going into too much detail M.E.C.A. stands for mechanically enhanced, cybernetic animals, and it is a story revolving around  three siblings, named 001, 002, and 003 , that have been thrust between the  new-world order  and the ways of  Old Gods .   They are in a race against time to learn about and adapt the old ways, or face complete assimilation and obliteration within the literal, modern machine.¬† Sky Guilds Loosely based off of the theme for a kickstarter I ran in 2017, Sky Guilds is centered around the idea of the different craftsman guilds that create the elements of the sky. You have the Star Painters, Weather Craft, Cloud Shepherds, Moon Phase Spinners, Constellation Alchemy and more!¬† Many More... I have a ton of other undeveloped worlds that I love building and then just let simmer while more ideas form. It is a constant process.¬† Print and Merchandise Production: Ever since I discovered that small artists could produce their own products and sell them to their fans I have wanted to do this. The idea of seeing my work out in the wild world always fills me with joy and encourages me to put more out there. Imagine what type of worlds others make with the help of my little critters and magical creations. The idea of all that creativity fills me with joy.  With Patreon support I am able to make things and explore ways to make those things responsibly. The thing with \"stuff\" is that it creates waste and waste is not what the world needs. In product production \"eco friendly\" options are often more expensive or have more limitations in their production process. With the funding support from Patreon I have been able to learn about and use various products in my shop that have a smaller footprint then just the standard production costs.¬† To Sum it Up: Experimenting and exploring new techniques and ideas takes time, energy and money, which are not always in ample supply. With the help of my Lovely Forest, the financial burden will be lessened allowing me more freedom to create weird and wonderful things to share! I started this patreon page in 2019 and never expected to create a community of such kind, creative and supportive people. It blows my mind every day how much has happened in the years since that first step. I am so excited to see what the future brings and I'm also excited to share it with you all.

And as far as we can tell, the album has done quite well up to today: we entered German album charts at #45, received outstanding reviews and critics and have played some great shows supporting the album. DISILLUSION are back! All of this was a dream come true, a new album after all those years, and would never have been possible without the 200 patrons who have maintained their loyalty and financial support since the very beginning of this Patreon campaign in March 2017 up to today! We will be grateful to you for all eternity! You are incredible!!! \n \nYou may call it a trademark of the band, that each of our songs has a certain depth ‚Äì musically and emotionally. After producing our ‚Äúcomeback‚Äù single ALEA in 2016 it was very clear to us that if Andy were to pursue his regular studio job parallel to writing new Disillusion material, it would take ages to complete a new record. And it also would not be certain if the material would reach that level of musicality that we and you - the fans - expect and want. This is exactly what this campaign is about: enabling Andy to  work full-time  on Disillusion - write the music and create the atmosphere and take care of everything around the band that needs to be done. While the others in the band pursue regular jobs and are dedicating the majority of the free-time to the band, Andy is simply doing the main job. We are serious: without you, all this would not be possible and no benefit, no reward that we think of, can make up for the chance that you give us - we do what we do best: music. But of course, if you decide to join this campaign, you will receive something in return - please read the tiers and benefits for details. ‚Ä¶ Today in 2021 - admits the worldwide pandemic - we are writing for and working on  THE FOURTH Disillusion Album . And we plan to release it as soon as possible in 2022 and not in some distant future as many fear. To do that as good and even better, we need You! Especially now when there are no shows being played, no money earned at live shows, no or very few merch sold - we need your support to go on! There is a road that we must travel ... together! If you have any question please send us an email to  [email¬†protected]   For now thank You very very much for your interest and time!

I'm Maxine and welcome to my Pin Club! With all the excitement surrounding my enamel pins I wanted a quick and stress-free solution for you to collect my pins. By signing up to my Patreon pin club it takes away the panic of making sure you're at your computer on time or the ever frustrating refreshing pages to see they've sold out. Now you can take all that frustration away by signing up for the monthly pin club and receiving your pins every month without worry of missing out! For the remainder of 2021 I'll be continuing my monthly mermaid pin series. These babies are 2.5 inches, Gold enamel with 2 rubber clutches. I always ensure they are of the best quality by checking each one myself. They come on collectable 4x6 backing cards with the original sketch to one side for those who wish to cut them into 4x4 sketch cards or keep them intact for your collection. These are a fun way to see the original vision next to the finished product. All pins also come with the matching sticker! Patreons will also get inside scoops on new designs and color schemes. Now the important info: Please select the tier based on where you located. These have specific shipping rates attached to each tier. Note that when you sign up you will be receiving the following month design (sign up in May, you will receive the June pin). Patreon automatically begins processing payments starting at 12:00 AM \nPST on the 1st. This process usually takes 1 - 5 days. If your payment \nis declined, you will get an email from Patreon asking you to fix your \npayment method. Will I get to see the month's design before I am charged? Yes! I will release the new design on the fourth week of the month before (at the latest). This gives you 7 days to cancel your subscription if you \ndecide you don't want next months pin. I joined in the middle of the month. Does this mean I will receive that month's rewards? No -- Patreon operates on a monthly payment system. When you join, you will receive the following month‚Äôs rewards! Example:\n If you pledge on May 15th, you won't be billed until June1st, and \nthe first pin you'll receive is the pin for the month of June. Can I get a refund if I don't like my pin? No. All pin club designs will be shown as a mockup \ndesign this will give you and idea of how it will look, it is upto you to decide if you want to cancel your subscription before the order processes. Please note that the design will be a digital mock up and may change slightly during the manufacturing process. Depending on your screen the colors may also appear differently. Refund Policy I don't offer refunds or cancellations after the 1st of each\nmonth, If you wish to  cancel, you must do so before your payment is processed. I will not refund or replace any lost or damaged items. Please pay for insured shipping to avoid this problem.

I'm the creator of the webcomics¬† Twin Dragons  and¬† Gamer Dragons . Twin Dragons  is a comic about the daily life of a dragon twin, Kai and Kaya Romero. It's a slice of life humor comic about animal hybrids in a predominantly human world and how they interact with each other. Gamer Dragons  is a spin-off from Twin Dragons with the same main characters. In this comic you will see game related jokes and shenanigans with the twin and their friends, all based in well known (or lesser known) games. What is patreon? I could post a lengthy explanation about this, but the following video explains it better than I ever could: Why should I donate? First of all, I want to state that the comics will always be free for everyone to read. No paywall or anything, since I hate that. There will only be extra's through the goals system, and those will be for everyone as well. As much as I like drawing these comics (and believe me, I love it), I need money to pay the bills. I've been in a very blessed situation where I could take the time to build the comic from the ground up and start drawing it, but I need support to keep doing this in the future. Right now, I'm looking at commissions as my only income, and to keep that up, I might not be able to keep both comics running in the future. That's where you loyal fans and great people come in. For as low as 1 dollar a month you could help me continue making you guys happy. Help me to keep drawing comics, and you can get some rewards as well as the satisfaction of knowing you helped me achieve my dream goal of being a full time comic artist.

Over my career, I've done a bit of everything including news, features, reviews, lists, walkthroughs, interviews, streams, podcasts, and general hosting.  Currently, I'm an independent game critic and content creator able to do what I do because of Patrons like you! When I'm not  streaming on Twitch  or writing for my own outlet,¬† Pen to Pixels , I'm on Kinda Funny's PlayStation podcast (PS I Love You XOXO) and MinnMax's flagship podcast (The MinnMax Show). Previously IGN editorial, I also have bylines at outlets such as¬†  Kotaku ,  PlayStation Lifestyle ,¬† Nerd Much ,¬† Hard Drive , and more.  I've been independent for a year now and have learned a lot along the way. One thing I'm committed to is growing, adjusting, and improving this Patreon page as I go so that it aligns with my goals as they change and develop.  Currently my goal is to write more about games on Pen to Pixels, bring back content to my person YouTube channel, and continue streaming on Twitch all while continuing my work with KF, MinnMax, and other projects that come across my desk.¬† ABOUT THIS PATREON Gameonysus is my personal brand (and handle across social media).¬†The name ‚ÄúGameonysus‚Äù (pronunced game-on-uh-sus) is inspired by the name Dionysus (the god of wine). For me, Gameonysus means ‚Äúgod of gaming,‚Äù which reflects  my overall goal . This isn‚Äôt to say I want to be the greatest gamer in the universe; rather,  I want my gaming experiences and the content I create to  be  a universe :  expansive, beautiful, curiosity-driven, and inspiring . I strive to  play a wide variety of games  and offer  opinions/insights that will benefit and enrich the lives of others. Here are the projects my Patreon is currently supportin g:¬† Twitch :¬† Best of 2023 Watch (Friday 3pm PT):  Streaming the biggest releases and the latest games on my radar to determine the best games of any given year: starting now with 2021.¬† Let's Play (Saturday; 3pm PT) : I want to do more full playthroughs on stream. I'll mostly use this for catching up on games I missed over the years and for playing games my community wants to see me try out. Pen to Pixels : This is my outlet which I started last year. You can expect reviews, previews, features, and lists. YouTube : Opinion videos, news reactions, spotlighting favorites, practical (gaming related) tips, and more.¬† Articles : I run a content creation and advice blog called  Game Industry Guides .¬† Building Community : I'm active on¬† Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok .

I love it every time someone does a double take at seeing a man cross stitching in public, and I love knowing I just jabbed a little needle into the eye of the patriarchy.

Once people saw my patterns they started asking to buy them. I put together a little e-commerce store with a couple patterns and I was off. I'd like to be able to dedicate more time to making patterns, and Patreon seemed like a good way to connect with people who are in this same journey.  I had to teach myself most of what I've learned about cross stitching, so I decided to start sharing that knowledge. During the great Quarantine of 2020, I started a YouTube channel to help others get started in the art form I love so much. I think it‚Äôs important to give back, so I always have a couple of patterns (and often my most popular) that I give away all the proceeds from.

Meal Magazine  is an independent print publication featuring thought-provoking food writing and striking art direction. Based in Minneapolis,  Meal Magazine  is produced by a small team of experienced writers, critics, and artists who are passionate about the power of food and drink to bring people together. We seek out and publish diverse stories that give us insight into this strange human experience, using food as our primary vehicle.¬† Meal  features stories from across the world that examine the social life of food through deep investigative journalism, personal essays, colorful profiles, and thoughtful original art and photography.  Meal  tells provocative stories that will stick with readers for years to come. And while  Meal  is a magazine about food and drink, it also looks to challenge the very notions of what ‚Äúfood writing‚Äù is, and who ‚Äúfood writers‚Äù are. It is a platform for moving and unconventional storytelling that features unique and diverse voices, resulting in a publication that uses food as a vehicle for exploring the critical issues of our time.  Meal  is for food lovers and anybody who enjoys getting lost in a good story. The debut issue  of Meal Magazine was published in January, 2020.¬† Issue #2  arrived in January, 2021. Issue #3 is up next, to be published in January 2022. From now on, Meal will be a bi-annual volume, with Issue #4 expected to arrive in June 2022.  When you join our Patreon at any level, you will we subscribed to Meal Magazine, and receive each issue right when it's published. In addition, you'll get our bi-monthly newsletter with updates on magazine production, original writing, and generally be on the inside of what our team is up to -- including being invited to special Patron-only events, and other fun stuff. For each issue, our editorial and art team gathers¬†the best food-centric writing, art, and commentary we can create and curate. We love the tactile, analog quality of a great magazine‚Äîit‚Äôs something to hold and sink into, to toss in a backpack or place on a bookshelf, to forget about and return to years later. In between each issue of the magazine, we will bring you along for the ride as we share videos, photos, livestreams, public hangouts, and more. Throughout the year, we'll also be working with our favorite chefs, bartenders, partners and brands to produce knockout food-centric events. Think: a surprise underground cocktail party in an unlikely location. An intimate ticketed dinner with a famous chef in someone's backyard. A game of horseshoes in the park with a local BBQ master helming the smoker. Special behind-the-scenes tours of a mushroom farm, brewery, or sports stadium. We've got some wild ideas, and we're gonna create some special experiences. WHO ARE WE? Meal Magazine's team  is founder and editor-in-chief Peter Sieve, co-founder and executive editor Joshua Page, executive editor Molly Each, editor-at-large Mecca Bos, developmental editor Letta Page, art director and designer Jake Luck, and co-art director and photographer Bill Phelps. \n WHY DO WE NEED YOU? \nCreating a magazine is a bold endeavor, particularly when we are committed to paying contributors fairly and putting out a beautiful periodical that we‚Äîand you‚Äîwill want to feature prominently in your homes and workplaces. And while we are seeking the support of some like-minded businesses, we really don‚Äôt want to overly fill the magazine with ads. Our patrons are our core financial support, helping us pay contributors and plan the printing and distribution costs of the magazine in advance. Besides simply being our collective sugar daddies, we greatly value the community we're building together here. You're always behind the scenes with us.  Being a Meal patron means you're part of our growing community ‚Äì we want to bring you into our circle, exchange thoughts and ideas with you in person, and give you some cool rewards in return.

My name is Lexi, and I've been designing enamel pins since April of 2018. I've been drawing for most of my life and collecting pins for about 5 years now, and I love running Pinfluential! I get to hone my art skills and learn more and more about drawing digitally, all the while creating designs inspired by anime and cartoons that I love.  \n Rewards \n For all tiers, you receive access to Patreon-exclusive content, polls, and behind-the-scenes sneak peeks at future projects, as well as enter Patreon-only giveaways! For the $3 tier, you also receive access to the Patreon secret shop, where you can purchase previous months‚Äô pins and stickers, as well as a 15% off discount code for my Etsy shop! The secret shop will also have some surprises dropped in there from time to time! These are all exclusive to Patreon members are are not to be shared elsewhere. \n How Patreon Works \n When you pledge, you will be charged upfront! I recommend pledging at the beginning of the month to maximize the amount of time you‚Äôll have your perks. After you pledge, you will be automatically charged on the 1st of every month. Patreon is a subscription service. You can unpledge at any time and will still have access to your perks until the 1st of the next month. In Regards to Past Pin Pledges If you are still waiting on pins that you‚Äôve pledged for, I will still be fulfilling all pending rewards once they finish production! Extras will drop in the secret shop at a later date.¬†***PLEASE NOTE: Due to COVID-related delays, production time is taking longer than usual. You may receive your rewards a few weeks later than expected. Thank you for your patience! \n \n New Rules Regarding Reselling/Trading (Updated 02/27/2021) \n I realize, looking at my Patreon policies, that there wasn‚Äôt an established rule before about reselling Patreon pins. My Patreon pins also weren‚Äôt being flipped for a lot of money before, so I didn‚Äôt feel the need to make a rule for it, but that rule is being established now: -Patreon pins that are still in stock OR the extras haven‚Äôt dropped yet can be sold for what you paid for/the shop price. -Reselling Patreon pins that are in stock/will have extras dropped for more than that will result in a warning the first time. Since this is a new rule, I want to be fair. -Doing this again will result in your removal/ban from my Patreon and secret shop. -I have no issue with people trading Patreon pins. Trade to your heart‚Äôs content, y‚Äôall. Please respect the new rules I‚Äôve put in place, and think twice about buying any of my Patreon pins that you see on Mercari , Depop, EBay, etc. Feel free to message me with any questions about product pricing or availability if you‚Äôre unsure! \n \n Patreon-Exclusive Shop (The Vault) \n The Vault Pledging for secret shop access comes with a password that will give you access to the vault (shoppinfluential.com) for an entire month. The shop link and password will be available to $3 pledgers in a pinned post each month! The password will change monthly, and please do NOT share it with people not in my pin club. If someone isn't a patron and tries to buy from there, I will refund the order. The Vault will have all previous months' pins and stickers üåüFor the LE50 variants of Patreon-exclusives, only one is allowed per person! I will automatically refund duplicates of the same LE pin. \n \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t To see more of my work, you can view it here: \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t \n \n Etsy Shop Instagram \n Facebook \n Twitter", "amount_post": 268, "amount_subs": 128, "price_tiers": [{"title": "Tip Jar", "monthly": "$1", "description": "Thank you for your support!

I am an irish artist and writer probably best known for the creation of the Magick and Divination system called  The Forty Servants  , which I both designed and illustrated, and¬† my comics such as  THE HOLY NUMBERS  and  THEM . \n If you want to know more about my background and where I come from then you can check out the About Section of my website  HERE . I'll not fill this page with a huge block of text that most of you will skip anyway :D \n \n Magick = Art? \n To me, Magick and Art are pretty much interchangeable ideas, or at the very least, next to impossible to separate. Magick is creativity; Art is Creativity. Magick is self-expression; Art is Self-expression. Both draw their inspiration from the primordial chaos; both are transformative in nature. Magick is an idea; Art is an idea.  Their final medium of expression may be different (one is your life the other could be a photograph) but the feel is the same. The transformative aspect is the same. The created sense of wonder is the same.  Magick, creating, and art are so intrinsically embedded within who I am as a person that I don't really know when one bit starts and the other ends.  But, with your help, these are the areas I want to explore!  \n \t \n \n \n Why Pledge?* \n \n Good question - why should you give me your money?  First off, to save any future confusion, I want to say that this Patreon is best viewed as NOT being a premium membership to a website or podcast or whatever. It's not really a subscription service where you pay a monthly subscription fee, then you get a product each month for being a member.  It's not really about you getting \"stuff\". It's about you helping me.  What it is instead is about you supporting me so that I can continue to make art, which right now is mostly my new comic  TURBINE SYNDROME , but there is a lot of other stuff I do - podcast, videos etc. There is no real end product that you get and I'm not selling you anything each month if that makes sense. I hope it does.  You send me your hard earned cash every month and I use that money to continue to make art.  The money that you pledge also goes towards paying for website and podcast hosting fees, it pays for better equipment and materials, and it allows me to get better software, and all that goodness that makes it possible for me to  level up ! \n So, it basically comes down to this: If you like what I do and would like to see me do more of it then you should pledge at whatever level you feel comfortable with. If you are looking for a premium membership deal where you get stuff every month then I will advise you to spend your hard earned cash elsewhere, as that's not really what this is.  NOW, with that all said, you do get some cool stuff if you do decide to pledge.  \n Depending on the reward tier you choose, you will have access to some or all of the following:  \n \t First to see and read the  new chapters of Turbine Syndrome ! See exclusive work-in-progress posts and videos on all future art! \t \t First access to any new Limited Edition Art\tPrints! \t \t All\tmy comics in PDF format available for immediate download. \t Digital Printable Version of the Deck. \t \t THE JOURNEY- A year-long Shadow Working using Servitors.12 Monographs and 12 Exclusive Downloadable and Printable Servitor \tartworks. \t \t\t Exclusive extra videos and podcasts, including the STUDY GROUP (Liber Null, The Quickening, the Runes, and  A Story Waiting to Pierce You ). \t We have a discord group where we discuss Magick and related topics. \t PDF version of the \tGrimoire of The Forty Servants. \t \t\t I only offer full divination readings for Patrons. \t Executive Producer Credit on Podcast and Videos. \t Exclusive videos and audios just for Patrons \t Access to the Patreon Only posts. \t Access to the Patreon Only Community. \t Patron level access\tto the AIWW Discord Server. \t And more as time goes on. \n \n And of course, there are already lots of exclusive videos, drawings, posts and whatnot already posted here for patrons just waiting for you to delve into.

Now, I want to make art  for  you and  with  you on Patreon! Sign up now to get a little piece of metal art each month in the form of a limited-edition enamel pin! \n \n \n The Plan¬† \nMy Patreon page is aimed to be something that can be sustained year after year with the format evolving as time goes by. I am starting with a Pin of the Month format that will hopefully grow into a few more tiers and options over time. \n \nPatreon is a crowdfunding platform; however, instead of pledging to support one specific project or idea, you are helping to support and gain access to an ongoing creation. By becoming a monthly patron, you are not only showing your support for me as an artist, but you are also helping to give me the freedom to create and produce more artwork than ever before.\n \n \n \n\t \n \n \n The Pins \nI am sharing a long-time passion of mine: collectable enamel pins. I have been amassing pins ever since I was a little girl when my mother, an Olympian, took me to the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. After growing a sizable collection, I longed to make pins of my very own‚Äîand now, thanks to your amazing support, I have finally been able to make that dream a reality! \n \nMy pins start inside my sketchbook and then become large-scale illustrations before being transformed into pin designs. Each design is made in a custom process which allows us to retain an extraordinary level of detail and to evoke the unique life of the original drawing. After line-art, colors, and other details are finalized, each pin is hand manufactured to our custom specifications. Every color in every cell must be filled by hand with enamel, baked in large kilns, and polished flat. After that, we assemble each one onto a unique backer card, bag them up, and ship them out to each of our collectors!\n \n \n \n\t \n \n \n What will you get?¬† \n \nDifferent levels of monthly subscriptions are available, depending on how much you wish to contribute as a Patron.  For now, there are two levels: \n \n \n A $1/month pledge  gets you exclusive access to an inside look at my pin creation process, monthly updates and coloring pages featuring my new designs, as well as exclusive product releases available for purchase before the general public. \n \n A $15* month pledge  gets you access to the pin of the month, along with all the benefits of the lower tier. Once a month, you will be mailed an original, high-quality, enamel pin of my own design.¬† \n \n\t *For international buyers, a $25 pledge is required to account for trackable shipping outside the United States and and its territories. Failure to select this higher amount may result in your spot being forfeited. \n \n \n\t \n \n \n \nWelcome Package \nWe love growing our crazy pin family! As a way to introduce you to our pins, we give each new Pin-of-the-Month member** ($15 for US/$25 for international)¬†a Welcome Package with your first shipment. The Welcome Package includes: \n\t One Printed Backer Card to use as a fun backdrop for your pin collection. Mount it on your pinboard to give your creatures a scene to live in! \n\t One of our \"Pin Guides\" to help to show you the ropes of the vast pin-collecting universe. \n\t And mystery surprises, like stickers, prints, or magnets! \n \n**Only one Welcome Package per person. Should you leave and rejoin you will not be eligible for a duplicate Welcome Package. This helps us to ensure that everyone receives the welcome they deserve. Thanks! \n \n Pin Details:¬† \nMost of my designs center around animals, nature, fantasy, myths and legends. I use lots of swirling shapes, rainbow galaxies, and small details. All of the pins that we make are created in this signature artistic style and also feature the following:\n \n \n\t Between 1.25‚Äù and 3‚Äù at the longest dimension. \n\t \n\tAt least 4 colors with various metal platings (silver, gold, holo, etc). \n\t Hard Enamel or Soft enamel with Epoxy coat. \n\t All of our pin-of-the-month pins are limited edition. This means that a finite number of pins are produced for each design which will not be reproduced in the same coloration once they have sold out. \n \n \n ¬†¬† \n \nPatreon Exclusive Content:\n \n \n The monthly pin subscription provides exclusive pins at a significant discount given only to patrons.  I tend to create intricate pins that are priced slightly higher than others on the market because of our level of detail, additional packaging, and innovative processes. \n \nAll pins in the monthly pin subscription will be limited edition based on the number of current members. Only after each patron has received their pin will the remaining pins be available on my website or at conventions at full retail price without the Patreon discount. Some months there may be no leftover pins, making them 100% Patreon-exclusive. Once these pins are made, they will never be remade with the Patreon exclusive colors again.\n \n \nOther exclusive content includes a first look at upcoming pins, process sketches, videos, periodic updates, and more!\n \n \n How does subscribing and billing work? \n \nPatrons are charged at the beginning of each monthly cycle; usually the 1st or the 2nd of each month. You are not locked in by signing up for Patreon. You can cancel at any time, but do note that if you cancel or wish to ‚Äúskip a month‚Äù you acknowledge that you may be forfeiting your spot for the following month if the membership is full.¬†\n \n \nPins will only be shipped after your card is charged at the 1st of the month and will require a few days of packaging and processing, with the goal of having all pins shipped by the 15th of each month. While we aim to have all pins shipped out by the middle of the month, some months may be shipped later due to production delays. This can be due to lengthened time for the creation of a more complex pin or other unforeseen circumstances. But not to worry! If you have paid for a month, you will receive your pin for that month!¬†\n \n \nPlease note that when signing up for Patreon, you are signing up for the \n next  month's pin design and rewards. Teasers will be released at the end of each month so that current patrons can decide whether or not they want to stay subscribed for next month. \n \n \nSo what are you waiting for?  \n\tSign up today so we can begin collecting and creating together!\n", "amount_post": 196, "amount_subs": 127, "price_tiers": [{"title": "Exclusive Access!", "monthly": "$1", "description": "\n No physical reward shipped, but lots of cool content that's only available to supporters!¬† Access to my Patron's-Only feed including sketches, pin concepts, monthly coloring pages, and more! \n Frequent discount codes and first access to new releases! \n"}, {"title": "USA Pin Subscription ", "monthly": "$15", "description": "One pin of the month with free shipping to any USA address One welcome package to be delivered with your first month's subscription!

I'm Gemma Chambers, I've been making art and drawing tutorials for Youtube since 2020. My videos have helped thousands of artists improve their skills and create realistic, professional drawings they can be proud of. I like to draw in a realistic style and I've spent years of trial and error and practice to develop my own approach and method to my drawings, and this is now what I teach in my videos.  I've set up this Patreon page for those that want to take their learning further - with longer, much more in depth projects you can follow at your own pace. ‚†Ä My Tutorial Style ‚†Ä I firmly believe that drawing should be a joy, something you can do to unwind or to make your free time more enjoyable - This is an important part of how I lay out my tutorials. I break each video down into multiple chapters. At the start of each chapter, I run through the main things that will come up - the colours we're looking for, the techniques I'll be using and generally what we're looking to achieve by the end of the chapter. Then, I hand over to you with the real time footage so you can draw along with me while listening to music or an audiobook, watching TV, talking to family, or whatever you like! You're safe in the knowledge I'm not going to suddenly jump in with more narration until we start the next chapter. ‚†Ä Project Variety ‚†Ä I want my tutorials to be accessible and enjoyable for everyone. I draw a variety of subjects including wildlife, people, botanical, still life and much more to keep things interesting. If you're a complete beginner, I have a series of introduction videos to each material to get you started, as well as shorter 'quick win' drawings and technique videos where I cover one particular aspect like drawing hair, eyes or fur. These lessons help build up your confidence to jump into the bigger projects.

I've started this community of patrons who get exclusive behind-the-scenes access to every element of \"Bad Boy\" and all future Artie O'Daly content. ¬†With scripts (both published and abandoned), outtakes, audio commentary, raw footage, and lots of personal updates from the writing and editing of the shorts - plus early access to videos before they're released to the public and a special \"Patrons Only\" section on the Artie O'Daly Discord server - there's SO MUCH that comes with your patronage! Whatever tier you choose, your patronage is invaluable to making quality comedic content on the Artie O'Daly channel for the underserved gay audience - and I'm thrilled to have you onboard. I hope you'll join the community - and thank you in advance if you do!
