If you are thinking about hopping on as a patron please be aware that if you pledge with no reward or outside of a tier you may have hiccups seeing content. The only content I currently post for \"all patrons\" is the Character Inspiration Digest. Everything else is tier specific.¬† \n\t As of June 2020 Patreon will be generating a sales tax on pledges  when applicable.  It will be based on the region you live in and not the region I live in so I can't anticipate who it will affect or how much it will be. \n\t A s of October 2019 I have switched to charging up front  so you will be charged immediately once you sign on as a patron and then the first of every month following that. I had some issues with people pledging,accessing content and then canceling the pledge and leaving before it went through so I'm switching payment setup to prevent any future content theft and prevent a few headaches.¬† Are you a family member,friend or someone who actually \"knows\" me?¬† Please be advised BEFORE you pledge that if you are uncomfortable or bothered by knowing too much about me that my Patreon content is not filtered,sugarcoated or censored at all.Caring about you or knowing you doesn't mean I can coddle you and shape my content around you.Nor does it make you an inside person with leverage or part of my business decisions here. That wouldn't be fair to me and it would be a jerk move to expect that on your end. If you don't want to know me very well and see messier sides of my existence than I would suggest not viewing my Patreon content. If you still want to support me as a family member or friend but want the lighter experience you can donate via Kofi. Please note that I do not refund pledges if you decide you are \"triggered\".  I am very clear on all my pieces of writing via tags,descriptions and trigger warnings. If something doesn't sound up your alley or seems like a topic that might disturb you or be hard to handle, please be mature enough to hit the back button. I post mainly mental health related content and all of my personal updates have some element of that as well since I live with disability and chronic illness. If you are sensitive to something then don't push yourself. I put partial responsibility and trust in my audience to make mature judgement calls about content they are viewing. I'm not going to bend over backwards and cry a river for you if you can't read or use decent judgment. Would you like me to revise or redact a piece of content?¬† Please be aware that I only revise,redact or change content on either a proven legal basis or when I want to,no exceptions.This policy is still in effect if you are someone I know personally or family. I am happy to hear from you about my content and listen to your concerns but please do not waste my time with unfounded demands or harassment. If you feel that I've somehow broken a legal boundary with one of my pieces of writing or art, I will be happy to look over your claim once you've done sufficient court filing on your own. I will not assist you in the matter but I will respectfully look over your case. Please also be advised that if you require reprinting any of my creations to prove legal proceedings ,for example printing an article to prove defamation, you will need to get permission to print those materials as all my writing is fully copyrighted to me and me alone,including the printing and reproduction rights.¬† If you reproduce any of my content illegally or alter it any way, I will be happy to bring it up in a counter-suit. \n \n \n\t Next  Newsletter/6 Sampler Characters: Nov. 1, 2022 Q4 Summary: January 2-5 2022 Next Fanpro Friday: TBA (currently archiving gen I) Next Sampler Digest: December 16,2022 Next Character Inspiration Digest:  TBA (working on backlog) 2022 Annual Flash Jam:  November 25,2022 Next Manga Creator Event:  March 2023 \n\t Please Note:  All of my past blogs are in the process of being restored to meet my new content guidelines..

My love is for landscape and nature which are the main focus of much of my work. I began my photography company at the end of 2016 and had some exciting successes. I feel now is the time to take the experience I have gained and really push to take H Tilsley Photography to a new level! \n \nI decided I would start a Patreon after coming back from travelling for a month in Japan. Having some time to take a step back from the business and see it all clearly I could see that a small regular amount of money coming in would make a huge difference, allowing me to properly invest and create projects that I cannot do otherwise. You may have seen my work around the flood defence in Cardiff. Luckily, that subject was just down the road for me, but I have lots of ideas that require more time, more travel and more resources.  \n \nMy hope is that through Patreon, and with your support, I will be able to create projects and content that not only matter to me but also to you. Patreon also gives me a space to interact with everyone on a more personal basis as well as a place where I can post content directly to those who do care about it. By creating a Patreon community I will be able to exchange ideas and content with you which can help me develop more meaningful projects. Along with this, being a photographer means I require quite a bit of equipment. Patreon will hopefully let me build up the money to occasionally replace things like lenses and upgrade items which are getting old. This means I can keep creating quality images and content to share with you!  \n \nAny support from you allows me to continue doing what I love. If you‚Äôre interested in my work, and want to give me a boost, just choose how much you want to pledge per month (even $1 makes a difference!) and select some great rewards like, postcards, prints, Q&A‚Äôs and monthly newsletters. \n \n And don‚Äôt worry! You can edit or cancel your pledge anytime you want."},

Don't feel like you are stuck. You're never stuck. Let me help you figure out how to push your comfortzone and stop feeling so damn trapped.¬†"}
